AB BackgroundHealthcare system sustainability is challenged by several critical issues; one of the most pressing is the ageing population. Traditional, episodic care delivery models are not designed for older people who are medically complex and frail. These individuals would benefit from health and social care that is more comprehensive, coordinated, person-centred and accessible in the communities in which they live. Delivering this is a challenging endeavour. Community-based health and social care professionals are siloed, dispersed across various locations and sectors, each with their own mental models, electronic health information systems, and means of communication. To move away from fragmented care delivery models and towards a more integrated approach to care, an analysis of the process of community-based comprehensive geriatric assessment was conducted in an urban location in Atlantic Canada. The purpose of the study was to identify where in the community-based comprehensive geriatric assessment process challenges and opportunities existed for moving towards a more integrated model of care delivery.MethodThe functional resonance analysis method (FRAM) and dynamic FRAM (DynaFRAM) modelling were used to model the community-based health and social care system and create a hypothetical patient journey scenario. Data collected to inform modelling consisted of document review, focus groups, and semi-structured interviews with health and social care professionals providing care and service to older people in the community setting.Findings.Challenges and opportunities for implementing integrated care in the local context were identified. Findings from the FRAM and DynaFRAM analysis informed the co-design of multi-level process improvement recommendations that aim to move the local community-based comprehensive geriatric assessment process towards a more integrated model of care.ConclusionsA transformative redesign of community-based health and social care in the local context is necessary but cannot be accomplished without an understanding of how health and social care professionals conduct their work and how older people may receive care under the dynamic conditions. The FRAM and DynaFRAM modelling provided an enhanced understanding of system operations and functionality and demonstrated a critical step that should not be overlooked for decision-makers in their efforts to implement a more integrated model of care.

AB BackgroundHealth system fragmentation directly contributes to poor health and social outcomes for older adults with multiple chronic conditions and their care partners. Older adults often require support from primary care, multiple specialists, home care, community support services, and other health-care sectors and communication between these providers is unstructured and not standardized. Integrated and interprofessional team-based models of care are a recommended strategy to improve health service delivery to older adults with complex needs. Standardized assessment instruments deployed on digital platforms are considered a necessary component of integrated care. The aim of this study was to develop strategies to leverage an electronic wellness instrument, interRAI Check Up Self Report, to support integrated health and social care for older adults and their care partners in a community in Southern Ontario, Canada.MethodsGroup concept mapping, a participatory mixed-methods approach, was conducted. Participants included older adults, care partners, and representatives from: home care, community support services, specialized geriatric services, primary care, and health informatics. In a series of virtual meetings, participants generated ideas to implement the interRAI Check Up and rated the relative importance of these ideas. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to map the ideas into clusters of similar statements. Participants reviewed the map to co-create an action plan.ResultsForty-one participants contributed to a cluster map of ten action areas (e.g., engagement of older adults and care partners, instrument's ease of use, accessibility of the assessment process, person-centred process, training and education for providers, provider coordination, health information integration, health system decision support and quality improvement, and privacy and confidentiality). The health system decision support cluster was rated as the lowest relative importance and the health information integration was cluster rated as the highest relative importance.ConclusionsMany person-, provider-, and system-level factors need to be considered when implementing and using an electronic wellness instrument across health- and social-care providers. These factors are highly relevant to the integration of other standardized instruments into interprofessional team care to ensure a compassionate care approach as technology is introduced.

AB BackgroundContinuing care is needed for the growing number of chronically ill patients who struggle with health problems after discharge. This study aims to elucidate the development process, functionalities, service protocols, and utilization of an Internet Plus Care (IPC) platform devised by our hospital to offer healthcare services to discharged patients.MethodsThis was a mixed study. After describing the development process, function and usage of IPC platform, we retrospectively collect data such as the general information of service recipients and service providers, service items, and service prices through the IPC platform from January 2021 to September 2023 to characterize these services.Results69 nurses delivered a total of 788 services to 211 patients through the IPC platform. The majority of services (N = 652, 82.7%) were delivered offline, with almost half of the recipients (N = 384, 48.7%) being elderly individuals. 46.4% of nurses provided services >= 3 times. Furthermore, 26.5% of patients received services three or more times. Notably, patients' care requirements exhibited variations across age groups, with wound care (n = 243, 63.3%), pressure injuries care (n = 50, 13.0%), and replacement of indwelling nasogastric tubes (n = 20, 5.2%) emerging as the top three services favored by the elderly.ConclusionsThe IPC platform demonstrates potential in delivering diverse health services to patients; however, the involvement of nurses and patients needs to be enhanced. It is necessary to implement relevant safeguard policies to promote the effective use of IPC platform for health management of discharged patients in the future.What does this paper contribute to the wider global clinical community?The prevalence of chronic diseases is on the rise, and patients with chronic diseases continue to struggle with health problems after discharge and require extended treatment and rehabilitation. Our study proves that IPC platform presents a promising avenue for addressing these challenges.It is anticipated that governmental authorities will undertake comprehensive policy, legislative, and medical insurance reforms to facilitate the extensive adoption of IPC platform-based services.

AB The World Health Organization emphasizes the importance of providing integrated care for older people. Taiwan is the fastest aging country in the world. In 2016, Taiwan implemented the Long-Term Care Plan 2.0 (TLTCP 2.0), aimed at providing integrated long-term care (LTC) services in communities. However, LTC service agencies have not been able to evaluate the level of integrated care they provide due to the lack of an effective assessment tool. To address this need, this study sets out to develop an integration assessment tool, namely the Self-Assessment for Service Integration in Long-Term Care (SASI-LTC), which will allow LTC agencies to self-evaluate their current level of integration from multiple perspectives. The SASI-LTC was developed based on Evashwick's framework, underwent two rounds of Delphi panels with twenty-six experts, and a pilot test with 243 valid questionnaires from administrators of Tier A agencies who are responsible for integrating LTC. The Delphi experts assessed the content with high levels of agreement using medians, the scale content validity index (SCVI) and item content validity index (ICVI). The SASI-LTC included four domains (inter-entity organization and management, integrated care coordination, integrated resources, and integrated information systems) with thirty items. The SASI-LTC showed good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94) and good validity, and a confirmatory factor analysis showed a good model fit index [chi 2/df = 1.38; RMSEA = 0.040; CFI = 0.963; SRMR = 0.049] in pilot testing. While the SASI-LTC is a useful and feasible tool for Taiwan's LTC service agencies to evaluate their level of integration in providing LTC services, it could also be used in other countries with minor adjustments to localization of items related to financial integration.

AB BackgroundIn Northwestern Switzerland, recent legislation tackles the needs of community-dwelling older adults by creating Information and Advice Centers (IACs). IACs are a new service in the community that aims to assess the needs and provide information on age-related issues to community-dwelling older adults and their families. Previous studies reported difficulties in reaching community-dwelling older adults for community-based programs. We aimed to: 1) systematically identify implementation strategies to promote the IAC among community care providers, older adults and informal caregivers; 2) monitor the delivery of these strategies by the IAC management; and 3) describe the impact of those strategies on reach of community-dwelling older adults. This study was conducted as part of the TRANS-SENIOR project.MethodsAs part of the INSPIRE feasibility assessment, we conducted a pre-test post-test study between March and September 2022. The sample included 8,840 older adults aged 65 + visiting/calling or being referred to the IAC for the first time. Implementation strategies were selected using implementation mapping and organized in bundles for each group of community care providers and older adults/caregivers. Our evaluation included: estimation of fidelity to the delivery of implementation strategies and bundles by the IAC management and their coverage; referral source of older adults to the IAC; and impact of the strategies on reach of the IAC on the 65 + population living in the care region. Adaptations to the strategies were documented using the FRAME-IS. Descriptive statistics were calculated and reported.ResultsSeven implementation strategies were selected and organized in bundles for each community care provider and older adults and their caregivers. The lowest fidelity score was found in implementation strategies selected for nursing homes whereas the highest score corresponded to strategies targeting older adults and caregivers. "Informational visits" was the strategy with the lowest coverage (2.5% for nursing homes and 10.5% for hospitals and specialized clinics). The main referral sources were self-referrals and referrals by caregivers, followed by nursing homes. The IAC reach among the 65 + population was 5.4%.ConclusionWe demonstrated the use of implementation mapping to select implementation strategies to reach community-dwelling older adults. The reach was low suggesting that higher fidelity to the delivery of the strategies, and reflection on the causal pathway of the implementation strategies might be needed.

TI Health care prioritization process for the elderly in rural Tanzania
   under decentralized system: Prospects and challenges
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction Beginning the early 1990s, many countries globally adopted the third-generation health sector reforms with a focus of strengthening the primary health care system through community participation. On the contrary, three decades later, primary health care systems in many Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) including Tanzania have remained weak. Specifically, priority setting for the vulnerable groups including the elderly have been weak. We aimed to analyse the prospects and challenges of the priority setting process for the elderly health care services following the 1990s health sector reforms in Tanzania.Methods We conducted an exploratory case study on priority setting process for the elderly healthcare services in Igunga and Nzega Tanzania. We carried out 24 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) with the positions of District medical officers, social welfare, Medical Officers in-charge (MOI), planning officers and health system information focal person. Additionally, we carried out two focus group discussions (FGDs), one from each district with six participants from each group. Participants for the FGDs were MOI, health secretary, representative members of Health Facility Governing Committee (HFGC) and Council Health Management Team (CHMT). Data were analyzed using the qualitative content analysis.Results Two categories emerged from the analysis of the transcripts. These were the prospects and challenges in priority setting for the elderly population under the decentralized health sector in rural Tanzania. The prospects included; the capacity of the LGAs on priority setting; existence of strategies used by LGAs; availability of teamwork spirit and the existence of guidelines for priority setting at LGAs. The challenges included difficulties of elderly identification, insufficient resources to implement the planned activities at the LGAs, unintegrated digitalized government health information tools or programs at the LGAs, interference of LGAs by the Central Government and low interest of stakeholders on elderly health care.Conclusion This study highlights the prospects and challenges facing priority setting for elderly care at the centralized health system in rural Tanzania. From the results the process is well organized but faces some challenges which if not addressed jeopardized and has potential to continue affecting the priority setting. Addressing the challenges highlighted requires joint efforts from both the elderly population in the community, healthcare providers and decision makers across all levels of the health system. This study serves as an eye-opener and calls for a bigger study to get a comprehensive picture of priority setting of the elderly health care in Tanzania.

AB Background: The implementation of family doctor contract service is a pivotal measure to enhance primary medical services and execute the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system. Achieving service coordination among various institutions is both a fundamental objective and a central element of contract services. Objective: The study aims to assess residents' evaluations and determining factors related to the coordination of health services within primary medical institutions across different regions of Shandong Province. The findings intend to serve as a reference for enhancing the coordination services offered by these institutions. Methods: The study employed a multi-stage stratified random sampling method to select three prefecture-level cities in Shandong Province with different economic levels. Within each city, three counties (districts) were randomly sampled using the same method. Within each county (district), three community health service centers and township health centers implementing family doctor contract services were selected randomly. Face-to-face questionnaire surveys were conducted with contracted residents using the coordination dimension of the revised Primary Care Assessment Tools Scale (PCAT) developed by the research team. Data analysis was conducted using such methods as one-way analysis of variance and multiple linear regression. Results: The sample included 3,859 contracted residents. The coordination dimension score of primary medical institutions averaged 3.41 +/- 0.18, with the referral service sub-dimension scoring 3.60 +/- 0.58 and the information system sub-dimension scoring 3.34 +/- 0.65. The overall score of the referral service sub-dimension surpassed that of the information system sub-dimension. Regression results indicated that the city's economic status, the type of contracted institutions, gender, education, marital status, income, occupation, health status, and endowment insurance payment status significantly influenced the coordinated service score of primary medical institutions (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The coordination of primary medical institutions in Shandong Province warrants further optimization. Continued efforts should focus on refining the referral system, expediting information infrastructure development, enhancing the service standards of primary medical institutions, and fostering resident trust. These measures aim to advance the implementation of the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment and two-way referral system.

AB Background As the ageing population grows, the demand for long-term care (LTC) services will rise, concurrently amplifying healthcare utilisation. This review aims to examine and consolidate information on LTC interventions that influence healthcare utilisation among older persons. Methods A scoping review was performed through a systematic search in PubMed, EBSCO CINAHL, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, APA PsycInfo, EBM Reviews - Health Technology Assessment, and EBM Reviews - NHS Economic Evaluation Database. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses published between 1 January 2010 and 2 June 2022 among older persons aged 60 and above were included. The characteristics of LTC interventions were mapped to the World Health Organization (WHO) Healthy Ageing Framework. The effect sizes of healthcare utilisations for LTC interventions were recalculated using a random-effects model. The methodological quality was assessed with the AMSTAR-2 checklist, while the quality of evidence for each association was evaluated using GRADE. Results Thirty-seven meta-analyses were included. The most prominent domain of the healthy ageing framework was managing chronic conditions. One hundred twelve associations between various LTC interventions and healthcare utilisations were identified, with 22 associations impacting healthcare utilisation. Four interventions were supported by suggestive or convincing evidence. Preventive home visits were found to reduce hospital admission (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.91, p = 0.005), caregiver integration during discharge planning (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.81, p < 0.001), and continuity of care (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.95, p = 0.018) reduced hospital readmission, and perioperative geriatric interventions reduced the length of hospital stay (MD: -1.50, 95% CI: -2.24, -0.76, p < 0.001). None of the associations impacted emergency department visits, medication use, and primary care utilisations with convincing evidence. Most reviews received low methodological quality. Conclusion The findings suggest that LTC interventions could benefit from transitioning to a community-based setting involving a multidisciplinary team, including carers. The spectrum of services should incorporate a comprehensive assessment to ensure continuous care.

AB Introduction Severe inequities in depression and its diagnosis and treatment among rural-dwelling, racial-minority and ethnic-minority older adults compared with their urban white counterparts result in cognitive impairment, comorbidities and increased mortality, presenting a growing public health concern as the United States (US) population ages. These inequities are often attributable to social and environmental factors, including economic insecurity, histories of trauma, gaps in transportation and safety-net services, and disparities in access to policy-making processes rooted in colonialism. This constellation of factors renders racial-minority and ethnic-minority older adults 'structurally vulnerable' to mental ill health. Fewer data exist on protective factors associated with social and environmental contexts, such as social support, community attachment and a meaningful sense of place. Scholarship on the social determinants of health widely recognises the importance of such place-based factors. However, little research has examined how they shape disparities in depression and treatment specifically, limiting the development of practical approaches addressing these factors and their effects on mental well-being for rural minority populations.Methods and analysis This community-driven mixed-method study uses quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews and ecological network research with 125 rural American Indian and Latinx older adults in New Mexico and 28 professional and non-professional social supporters to elucidate how place-based vulnerabilities and protective factors shape experiences of depression among older adults. Data will serve as the foundation of a community-driven plan for a multisystem intervention focused on the place-based causes of disparities in depression. Intervention Mapping will guide the intervention development process.Ethics and dissemination This study has been reviewed and approved by the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Institutional Review Board. All participants will provide informed consent. Study results will be disseminated within the community of study through community meetings and presentations, as well as broadly via peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations and social media.

AB Background and Objectives Public health concerns surrounding social isolation and loneliness heightened during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as infection prevention measures led to increased feelings of loneliness and depression. Our objective was to evaluate the implementation of the HOW-R-U? program, during the pandemic (March 2020-December 2021). HOW-R-U? is a weekly volunteer-delivered telephone program designed to facilitate social connection and ease feelings of social isolation, loneliness, and depression in older people.Research Design and Methods This pragmatic study used the Implementation Framework for Aged Care to adapt and implement HOW-R-U? in an Australian aged and community care organization and a tertiary health service in Melbourne. The evaluation involved analysis of program data, semistructured interviews, and surveys with program recipients, volunteers, and referrers. A process evaluation was conducted alongside an assessment of outcomes including pre- and post-symptoms of isolation, depression, and loneliness.Results The implementation evaluation indicated that codesigned systems and processes effectively supported the ongoing implementation of HOW-R-U? with transition into business as usual across both organizations. Recipients reported that telephone calls had a positive impact on their lives, whereas volunteers reported enjoyment of supporting others. Several challenges were identified, namely in program reach and fidelity.Discussion and Implications HOW-R-U? was well regarded by all involved, and evaluation learnings have informed implementation into business as usual by both organizations.

AB Background Universal Health Coverage has been openly recognized in the United Nations health-related Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, though missing under the Millennium Development Goals. Ghana implemented the National Health Insurance Scheme programme in 2004 to improve financial access to healthcare for its citizens. This programme targeting low-income individuals and households includes an Exempt policy for older persons and indigents. Despite population ageing, evidence of the participation and perceptions of older persons in the scheme in cash grant communities is unknown. Hence, this paper examined the prevalence, perceptions and factors associated with health insurance enrollment among older persons in cash grant communities in Ghana.Methods Data were from a cross-sectional household survey of 400 older persons(60 + years) and eight FGDs between 2017 and 2018. For the survey, stratified and simple random sampling techniques were utilised in selecting participants. Purposive and stratified sampling techniques were employed in selecting the focus group discussion participants. Data analyses included descriptive, modified Poisson regression approach tested at a p-value of 0.05 and thematic analysis. Stata and Atlas-ti software were used in data management and analyses.Results The mean age was 73.7 years. 59.3% were females, 56.5% resided in rural communities, while 34.5% had no formal education. Two-thirds were into agriculture. Three-fourth had non-communicable diseases. Health insurance coverage was 60%, and mainly achieved as Exempt by age. Being a female [Adjusted Prevalence Ratio (APR) 1.29, 95%CI:1.00-1.67], having self-rated health status as bad [APR = 1.34, 95%CI:1.09-1.64] and hospital healthcare utilisation [APR = 1.49, 95%CI:1.28-1.75] were positively significantly associated with health insurance enrollment respectively. Occupation in Agriculture reduced insurance enrollment by 20.0%. Cited reasons for poor perceptions of the scheme included technological challenges and unsatisfactory services.Conclusion Health insurance enrollment among older persons in cash grant communities is still not universal. Addressing identified challenges and integrating the views of older persons into the programme have positive implications for securing universal health coverage by 2030.

AB China faces a significant population of individuals with disabilities, and the aging demographic exacerbates this challenge. There is an urgent need for accessible environments for vulnerable groups such as persons with disabilities, the elderly, and pregnant women. Consequently, this study aimed to explore the factors influencing satisfaction with accessible travel in old communities in Nanchang City. Adopting a perspective encompassing vulnerabilities across all age groups, we employed interviews, on-site surveys, questionnaires, and literature reviews to construct a model of satisfaction with accessible travel. This model comprises five evaluation dimensions: pedestrian pathways, public spaces, signage guidance, social support, and software provision, encompassing twenty-seven influencing factors. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to validate the model. The research findings indicated that social support (0.697), pedestrian pathways (0.480), and public spaces (0.291) exerted a significant overall effect on satisfaction within the model, whereas the influence of software provision (0.225) and signage guidance (0.249) was comparatively smaller. Vulnerable groups within the community prioritized operational maintenance (0.818) and cultural advocacy (0.791) within social support. They also emphasized aspects of pedestrian pathways such as elevation treatment (0.809) and pavement design (0.803), as well as rest facilities (0.804) and service facilities (0.790) within public spaces. Finally, based on the weighted ranking of factors among latent variables, we propose corresponding optimization strategies and development proposals. This paper contributes to providing theoretical, practical, and technical support for the design of community accessibility that caters to socially vulnerable groups across "universal and all-ages" groups. It plays a proactive role in enhancing the quality of life for these vulnerable groups and promoting the improvement of accessibility environments in old communities.

AB Objectives Diet and physical activity are crucial for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to maintain good health. Digital health interventions can increase access to lifestyle services. However, consumers' perspectives are unclear, which may reduce the capacity to develop interventions that align with specific needs and preferences. Therefore, this review aims to synthesise the preferences of people with CKD regarding digital health interventions that promote healthy lifestyle. Design Qualitative systematic review with meta-ethnography. Data sources Databases Scopus, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were searched between 2000 and 2023. Eligibility criteria Primary research papers that used qualitative exploration methods to explore the preferences of adults with CKD (>= 18 years) regarding digital health interventions that promoted diet, physical activity or a combination of these health behaviours. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers screened title, abstract and full text. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. Consumers' quotes were extracted verbatim and synthesised into higher-order themes and subthemes. Results Database search yielded 5761 records. One record was identified following communication with a primary author. 15 papers were included. These papers comprised 197 consumers (mean age 51.0 +/- 7.2), including 83 people with CKD 1-5; 61 kidney transplant recipients; 53 people on dialysis. Sex was reported in 182 people, including 53% male. Five themes were generated regarding consumers' preferences for digital lifestyle interventions. These included simple instruction and engaging design; individualised interventions; virtual communities of care; education and action plans; and timely reminders and automated behavioural monitoring. Conclusion Digital health interventions were considered an important mechanism to access lifestyle services. Consumers' preferences are important to ensure future interventions are tailored to specific needs and goals. Future research may consider applying the conceptual framework of consumers' preferences in this review to develop and evaluate the effect of a digital lifestyle intervention on health outcomes.

AB Today, population aging is the main trend of population development. Home-based care is mainly adopted in Chinese society, and scholars have paid ample attention to the effect of intergenerational support on the mental health of older people. However, research conclusions differ. This study uses data from the 2018 China Health and Pension Tracking Survey (CHARLS), which we analyzed with STATA software to construct least squares regression and two-stage least squares regression models. The regression model included 6,647 respondents to investigate the mental health status of older people based on depression status. Intergenerational support was defined as economic support, emotional support, and daily care provided by the children of older people. We studied the impact of three aspects of intergenerational support on the mental health of the elderly. We performed a robustness test using the variable replacement and propensity score matching methods, and analyzed age, gender, and urban-rural heterogeneity. The results showed that economic support had no significant impact on the mental health of older people, while emotional support and daily care had a positive effect. The heterogeneity results indicated that the relationship between intergenerational support and mental health of older people differed significantly based on age, gender, and urban and rural areas. Therefore, children should raise their awareness of supporting their parents, pay attention to their parents' mental health, and provide emotional support and daily care. Furthermore, community work improves family relations, creates a good social environment, and encourages young people to respect and be filial to older people. The government should improve the medical security system and old-age service system, and provide policy support to help the mental health of older people.

AB Objectives We drew on fundamental cause theory and the weathering hypothesis to examine how discrimination influences aging for midlife and older adults in Canada.Methods Using nationally representative data, we assessed the associations between discrimination and pain and functional limitations among adults aged 45 years and older. Discrimination was measured using a modified version of the Everyday Discrimination Scale. Chi-square tests were performed to check for baseline differences in the dependent and key predictor variables by race. Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations of discrimination, race, and sense of belonging with pain and functional limitations, net of sociodemographic characteristics, and socioeconomic status.Results Indigenous respondents showed a clear health disadvantage, with higher rates of pain and functional limitations compared to Whites and Asians. Self-reported discrimination was also higher for Indigenous midlife and older adults than for their White and Asian age counterparts. Discrimination had a direct and robust association with pain (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-1.87) and functional limitations (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.29-1.87). However, race moderated the impact of discrimination on functional limitations for Blacks. Finally, a strong sense of belonging to one's local community was protective against pain and functional limitations for all racial groups.Discussion Future research needs to further examine the impact of discrimination on Indigenous peoples' aging process. High rates of discrimination coupled with a greater burden of pain mean that Indigenous midlife and older adults may require additional and targeted health and social service resources to age successfully.

AB Adherence to scheduled physician screenings for renal function monitoring in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those at high risk remains suboptimal despite the endorsement of regular screenings by several clinical practice guidelines. Our study aims to assess the effectiveness of a point-of-care CKD screening program led by these pharmacists using the PICCOLO device while recognizing the unique position of community pharmacists in primary care. We conducted an 11-month prospective point-of-care interventional research study in the United Arab Emirates to evaluate the performance of a community pharmacist-led CKD screening program for high-risk patients. Six diverse community pharmacies were selected based on staff availability, patient volume, and their offered range of services. Eligible individuals with risk factors for CKD were identified during medication evaluations. The PICCOLO Comprehensive Metabolic Panel facilitated on-site blood analysis, delivering estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) results within 10 to 15 min. Data also included eGFR categories, demographic information, and insights into lifestyle and health habits collected through a questionnaire. Pharmacists conducted comprehensive medication reviews and offered referrals and lifestyle guidance as part of the program. The study encompassed a total of 400 patients, with an average age of 69 +/- 13.4 years within the study cohort. Notably, 38.8% (155 individuals) of the 400 patients were found to have undiagnosed CKD stages 3-5. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between a higher incidence of CKD stages 3-5 and factors such as older age, a history of hypertension, vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. In the multivariate regression model, age and a history of diabetes mellitus emerged as significant predictors of an elevated risk of CKD. This study sheds light on the viability and impact of CKD screening programs conducted by community pharmacists, particularly in detecting CKD stages 3-5. The findings have implications for healthcare policies, as they can influence the enhancement of early detection and management of CKD. Moreover, these insights may catalyze focused screening initiatives and strengthen collaboration between community pharmacies and healthcare systems to benefit patients at high risk of CKD.

AB OBJECTIVE To synthesise evidence of the effectiveness of community based complex interventions, grouped according to their intervention components, to sustain independence for older people. DESIGN Systematic review and network meta -analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception to 9 August 2021 and reference lists of included studies. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials or cluster randomised controlled trials with >= 24 weeks' follow-up studying community based complex interventions for sustaining independence in older people (mean age >= 65 years) living at home, with usual care, placebo, or another complex intervention as comparators. MAIN OUTCOMES Living at home, activities of daily living (personal/ instrumental), care home placement, and service/ economic outcomes at 12 months. DATA SYNTHESIS Interventions were grouped according to a specifically developed typology. Random effects network meta -analysis estimated comparative effects; Cochrane's revised tool (RoB 2) structured risk of bias assessment. Grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) network meta-analysis structured certainty assessment. RESULTS The review included 129 studies (74 946 participants). Nineteen intervention components, including "multifactorial action from individualised care planning" (a process of multidomain assessment and management leading to tailored actions), were identified in 63 combinations. For living at home, compared with no intervention/placebo, evidence favoured multifactorial action from individualised care planning including medication review and regular follow-ups (routine review) (odds ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.59; moderate certainty); multifactorial action from individualised care planning including medication review without regular follow-ups (2.55, 0.61 to 10.60; low certainty); combined cognitive training, medication review, nutritional support, and exercise (1.93, 0.79 to 4.77; low certainty); and combined activities of daily living training, nutritional support, and exercise (1.79, 0.67 to 4.76; low certainty). Risk screening or the addition of education and self-management strategies to multifactorial action from individualised care planning and routine review with medication review may reduce odds of living at home. For instrumental activities of daily living, evidence favoured multifactorial action from individualised care planning and routine review with medication review (standardised mean difference 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.00 to 0.21; moderate certainty). Two interventions may reduce instrumental activities of daily living: combined activities of daily living training, aids, and exercise; and combined activities of daily living training, aids, education, exercise, and multifactorial action from individualised care planning and routine review with medication review and self-management strategies. For personal activities of daily living, evidence favoured combined exercise, multifactorial action from individualised care planning, and routine review with medication review and self-management strategies (0.16, -0.51 to 0.82; low certainty). For homecare recipients, evidence favoured addition of multifactorial action from individualised care planning and routine review with medication review (0.60, 0.32 to 0.88; low certainty). High risk of bias and imprecise estimates meant that most evidence was low or very low certainty.
   Few studies contributed to each comparison, impeding evaluation of inconsistency and frailty. CONCLUSIONS The intervention most likely to sustain independence is individualised care planning including medicines optimisation and regular follow-up reviews resulting in multifactorial action. Homecare recipients may particularly benefit from this intervention. Unexpectedly, some combinations may reduce independence. Further research is needed to investigate which combinations of interventions work best for different participants and contexts.

AB ObjectiveThis study examines the impacts of urbanisation-induced displacement on rural older villagers and the issues of rebuilding ageing in place in Suzhou Municipality in China's Jiangsu Province.MethodsThe study employed a qualitative research method involving three measures of data collection, including 20 older-adult interviews, 14 key informant interviews (with street and community administrators, managers of service companies, managers of nursing homes and community doctor) and participant observation of older villagers' daily life in urban resettlement communities.ResultsThe displacement and resettlement of villagers for urbanisation had serious negative impacts on older villagers, including financial insecurity, relative deprivation and radical changes to the living environment. The community services were limited and insufficient, but the resettlement of the whole village in the same place enabled the village community to maintain social and cultural continuities, which facilitated older villagers' adaptation to the new urban place. Filial piety, though weakened and transformed, continued to play an important role in regulating old-age support, but descending familism reduced family resources for old-age support.ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of examining the impacts of external social and economic forces, such urbanisation in China, on ageing in place. We draw three conclusions based on empirical research in Suzhou: (1) the resettlement of older villagers in urban areas did not significantly narrow the rural-urban gap in old-age support in Suzhou; (2) urbanisation-induced displacement in China affected older residents differently from gentrification in Western countries, due to different processes of compensation and resettlement as well as China's rural-urban welfare gap; and (3) community services for displaced older villagers are limited, but social and cultural continuities before and after resettlement have helped older villagers adapt to the new urban place.

AB Background Primary mental healthcare (PMHC) allows for complex mental health issues in old age to be addressed. India has sought to improve PMHC through legislation, strategies and programmes. This study analyses the challenges and opportunities involved in strengthening PMHC for older persons in India from the perspectives of key stakeholders.
   Methods Semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 stakeholders selected from the PMHC system in India and analysed using thematic analysis. First, the analysis was organizationally structured in accordance with the six WHO mental health system domains: (1) policy and legislative framework, (2) mental health services, (3) mental health in primary care, (4) human resources, (5) public information and links to other sectors, and (6) monitoring and research. Second, for each building block, challenges and opportunities were derived using inductive coding.
   Results This study highlights the numerous challenges that may be encountered when attempting to strengthen age-inclusive PMHC. Among these challenges are poor public governance, a lack of awareness and knowledge among policy-makers and other stakeholders, and existing policies that make unrealistic promises to weak primary healthcare (PHC) structures with an excessive focus on medicalizing mental health problems. Thus, the mental health system often fails to reach vulnerable older people through PHC. Established approaches to comprehensive, family- and community-oriented PHC support attempts to strengthen intersectoral approaches to PMHC that emphasize mental health promotion in old age. Targeting the PHC workforce through age-inclusive mental health education is considered particularly necessary. Experts further argue that adequate monitoring structures and public spending for mental health must be improved.
   Conclusions In this study, we aim to elaborate on the mental healthcare developments that may serve to achieve equity in access to mental healthcare in India. Coordinated and collaborative efforts by public and private stakeholders involved in the care of older persons, both with and without lived mental health experiences, as well as their families and communities, are necessary to bring the vision of those policies for PMHC to fruition. The findings presented in this study can also inform future research, policies and practice in other low- and middle-income countries.

AB Transgender, non -binary, and intersex (TNBI) older adults experience significant disparities in sexual and reproductive healthcare. Utilizing data from 50 semi -structured individual interviews with TNBI older Americans, we examine how TNBI older adults experience and mitigate inequity in sexual and reproductive healthcare. We explore elders' negotiation of inequity through what we term resourcefulness strategies - tactical processes involving marginalized communities obtaining and utilizing resources to minimize inequalities within and beyond healthcare settings. Resourcefulness strategies differ from resiliency insofar as they directly acknowledge the need for social privilege, capital, and resources - on a community level - to overcome difficult situations (e. g., inequalities in healthcare), rather than drawing upon individual coping strategies alone. Our analysis reveals medical providers' lack of cultural competency with TNBI communities and older adults as primary drivers of TNBI older adults' experiences of inequity within sexual/reproductive healthcare settings. Consequently, TNBI older adults aimed to minimize inequity in sexual/reproductive healthcare through particular resourcefulness strategies. Specifically, we found a bifurcation in respondents' strategies, wherein trans men engaged in health service avoidance while trans women and non -binary respondents engaged in health service self -advocacy. These strategies required respondents to assume primary responsibility for transforming (or avoiding) sexual/reproductive health services that were perceived as lacking or actively harmful. We argue that such approaches are neither effective nor structurally -sustainable for attaining older -age and TNBI-affirming, inclusive, and culturally -competent healthcare for TNBI older patients.

TI Perspectives on Emergency Preparedness Among Indigenous Pacific People
   in Hawaii: A Qualitative Study
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH NURSING
LA English

ID UNITED-STATES; CARE; RESILIENCE; DISASTERS
AB PurposeThis study sought an improved understanding of household emergency preparedness (EP) among Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Filipino (Indigenous Pacific People [IPP]) parents in Hawaii.DesignWe conducted an exploratory qualitative descriptive study with 60-minute interviews occurring from October 2022 through March 2023. A semi-structured interview guide exploring participant household EP was employed.MethodsProspective participants were females who identified as IPP, caregivers of a 0-12-year-old child, spoke English, and received health services at a federally qualified health center clinic. Two researchers conducted qualitative content analysis on interview transcripts. Initial coding of transcripts identified broad categories or themes. The process was reviewed continuously to verify data and coding procedures. Three investigators independently verified final themes and subthemes.FindingsParticipants (N=25) were female, between 30-49 years of age (68%), had received some college education (60%), and were fully employed (68%). Major themes included: 1) Perceptions of family EP and current behaviors, 2) Barriers and challenges to family EP, and 3) Perspectives on strategies to improve family EP. Subthemes included risk perception for emergencies; family EP practices; health protection and pandemic preparedness; lack of knowledge and experience; social, cultural and economic barriers; and clinic-based, technology-driven, and community-based interventions.ConclusionFactors impeding access to healthcare services also impede family EP among IPP groups and their ability to mitigate the impact of future public health emergencies.Clinical EvidenceTargeted, innovative interventions, including ones led by health clinics and those that utilize technology, are needed to overcome common barriers faced and to facilitate the uptake of household EP behaviors among IPP families.

DE Mental health; Interventions; Older adults; Global mental health
AB BackgroundMental health services are scarce in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and designing and implementing effective interventions can be difficult. The aim of this international study was to explore the key lessons for developing, implementing, and evaluating community-based mental health and well-being interventions in LMICs, with an additional focus on older adults.MethodsResearch and clinical experts in developing and implementing psychosocial community-based interventions in LMICs were interviewed remotely between October 2021 and January 2022. Participants were recruited via existing global health networks and via published literature searches. Participants were asked about their experiences of developing and implementing interventions, and about key barriers and facilitators during the process. Interviews lasted up to 45 min, and data were analysed using combined inductive and deductive thematic analysis.ResultsSixteen global mental health experts participated. Five themes with different sub-themes were generated: Mechanisms and contexts; Barriers; Facilitators; Public and stakeholder involvement; Looking through an ageing lens. The development and delivery of mental health interventions in LMICs are facilitated through integration into existing health infrastructures and working with existing job roles as delivery agents. Public and stakeholder involvement are crucial at all stages of development through to implementation to focus on meeting local needs and sustaining participant motivation. Logistical barriers of transport, resources, and location need to be addressed, emphasising local sustainability.ConclusionsThis study provides important insights for how the development, implementation, and evaluation of community-based mental health and well-being interventions in LMICs can be optimised, and can complement general guidance into complex interventions developments.

AB BackgroundThe world population is ageing rapidly. Rehabilitation is one of the most effective health strategies for improving the health and functioning of older persons. An understanding of the current provision of rehabilitation services in primary care (PC) is needed to optimise access to rehabilitation for an ageing population. The objectives of this scoping review are a) to describe how rehabilitation services are currently offered in PC to older persons, and b) to explore age-related differences in the type of rehabilitation services provided.MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis of a scoping review examining rehabilitation models for older persons, with a focus on PC. Medline and Embase (2015-2022) were searched to identify studies published in English on rehabilitation services for people aged 50 + . Two authors independently screened records and extracted data using the World Health Organization (WHO)'s operational framework, the Primary Health Care Systems (PRIMASYS) approach and the WHO paper on rehabilitation in PC. Data synthesis included quantitative and qualitative analysis.ResultsWe synthesised data from 96 studies, 88.6% conducted in high-income countries (HICs), with 31,956 participants and identified five models for delivering rehabilitation to older persons in PC: community, home, telerehabilitation, outpatient and eldercare. Nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists were the most common providers, with task-shifting reported in 15.6% of studies. The most common interventions were assessment of functioning, rehabilitation coordination, therapeutic exercise, psychological interventions, and self-management education. Environmental adaptations and assistive technology were rarely reported.ConclusionsWe described how rehabilitation services are currently provided in PC and explored age-related differences in the type of rehabilitation services received. PC can play a key role in assessing functioning and coordinating the rehabilitation process and is also well-placed to deliver rehabilitation interventions. By understanding models of rehabilitation service delivery in PC, stakeholders can work towards developing more comprehensive and accessible services that meet the diverse needs of an ageing population. Our findings, which highlight the role of rehabilitation in healthy ageing, are a valuable resource for informing policy, practice and future research in the context of the United Nations Decade of Healthy Ageing, the Rehab2030 initiative and the recently adopted WHA resolution on strengthening rehabilitation in health systems, but the conclusions can only be applied to HICs and more studies are needed that reflect the reality in low- and middle-income countries.

TI Expanding Access to Comprehensive Geriatric Evaluation via Telehealth:
   Development of Hybrid-Virtual Home Visits

AB BackgroundIn response to the aging population, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seeks to expand access to evidence-based practices which support community-dwelling older persons such as the Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders (GRACE) program. GRACE is a multidisciplinary care model which provides home-based geriatric evaluation and management for older Veterans residing within a 20-mile drive radius from the hospital. We sought to expand the geographic reach of VA-GRACE by developing a hybrid-virtual home visit (TeleGRACE).ObjectivesThe objectives were to: (1) describe challenges encountered and solutions implemented during the iterative, pre-implementation program development process; and (2) illustrate potential successes of the program with two case examples.DesignQuality improvement project with longitudinal qualitative data collection.Program DescriptionThe hybrid-virtual home visit involved a telehealth technician travelling to patients' homes and connecting virtually to VA-GRACE team members who participated remotely.Approach & ParticipantsWe collected multiple data streams throughout program development: TeleGRACE staff periodic reflections, fieldnotes, and team meeting notes; and VA-GRACE team member interviews.Key ResultsThe five program domains that required attention and problem-solving were: telehealth connectivity and equipment, virtual physical examination, protocols and procedures, staff training, and team integration. For each domain, we describe several challenges and solutions. An example from the virtual physical examination domain: several iterations were required to identify the combination of telehealth stethoscope with dedicated headphones that allowed remote nurse practitioners to hear heart and lung sounds. The two cases illustrate how this hybrid-virtual home visit model provided care for patients who would not otherwise have received timely healthcare services.ConclusionsThese results provide a blueprint to translate an in-person home-based geriatrics program into a hybrid-virtual model and support the feasibility of using hybrid-virtual home visits to expand access to comprehensive geriatric evaluation and ongoing care for high-risk, community-dwelling older persons who reside geographically distant from the primary VA facility.

AB BACKGROUND:Few studies on care transitions following acute stroke have evaluated whether referral to community-based rehabilitation occurred as part of discharge planning. Our objectives were to describe the extent to which patients discharged home were referred to community-based rehabilitation and identify the patient, hospital, and community-level predictors of referral.
   METHODS:We examined data from 40 North Carolina hospitals that participated in the COMPASS (Comprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services) cluster-randomized trial. Participants included adults discharged home following stroke or transient ischemic attack (N=10 702). In this observational analysis, COMPASS data were supplemented with hospital-level and county-level data from various sources. The primary outcome was referral to community-based rehabilitation (physical, occupational, or speech therapy) at discharge. Predictor variables included patient (demographic, stroke-related, medical history), hospital (structure, process), and community (therapist supply) measures. We used generalized linear mixed models with a hospital random effect and hierarchical backward model selection procedures to identify predictors of therapy referral.
   RESULTS:Approximately, one-third (36%) of stroke survivors (mean age, 66.8 [SD, 14.0] years; 49% female, 72% White race) were referred to community-based rehabilitation. Rates of referral to physical, occupational, and speech therapists were 31%, 18%, and 10%, respectively. Referral rates by hospital ranged from 3% to 78% with a median of 35%. Patient-level predictors included higher stroke severity, presence of medical comorbidities, and older age. Female sex (odds ratio, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.12-1.38]), non-White race (2.20 [2.01-2.44]), and having Medicare insurance (1.12 [1.02-1.23]) were also predictors of referral. Referral was higher for patients living in counties with greater physical therapist supply. Much of the variation in referral across hospitals remained unexplained.
   CONCLUSIONS:One-third of stroke survivors were referred to community-based rehabilitation. Patient-level factors predominated as predictors. Variation across hospitals was notable and presents an opportunity for further evaluation and possible targets for improved poststroke rehabilitative care.REGISTRATION:URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02588664.

AB Introduction: There is a lack of information about the experiences of people living with dementia and their carers, especially in rural and regional areas. Understanding these experiences helps to identify gaps and unmet needs within the health system and improve quality of care and outcomes for people living with dementia. The aim of this study was to improve our knowledge of dementia support needs. This included access to health and social care services and supports for people living with dementia and those who provide informal or formal support to someone living with dementia.Methods: Interviews were conducted with 26 participants from the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia with knowledge of dementia care. Purposive sampling engaged people with lived experience, carers/family members and health professionals delivering dementia care and social services. Discussions centred around participants' experiences of support services, the diagnosis process and what they thought was needed to improve the services and supports offered. Thematic analysis of the data was undertaken using the framework method.Results: The interview data indicated that the needs of many people living with dementia and their carers were not currently being met. The themes were limited access to services and supports, including primary and specialist care, often impacted by lack of knowledge of care options, difficulty navigating the system and funding models as a barrier, leading to delays in getting a diagnosis and accessing specialist services; lack of holistic care to enable people living with dementia to 'live well'; and stigma impacted by a lack of knowledge of dementia among professionals and in the community. Relationship centred care was described as a way to improve the lives of people living with dementia.Conclusion: Key areas for improvement include increasing community awareness of dementia and available local services, more support to obtain an early dementia diagnosis, increased help to navigate the system, especially immediately after diagnosis, and easier access to appropriate home support services when they are needed. Other recommendations include personcentred care across settings - supported by funding models, more education and communication skills training for health professionals and care staff - and greater support for and increased recognition of carers.

TI Co-designing action-oriented mental health conversations between care
   providers and ageing Canadians in the community: a participatory
   mixed-methods study protocol
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article

ID DATA SATURATION; COVID-19
AB Introduction The mental health of ageing Canadians is a growing concern, particularly post-pandemic. Older adults face systemic ageism and mental health stigma as pervasive barriers to seeking needed mental health support, care and treatment within health and social care systems. These barriers are exacerbated when service providers focus on physical healthcare needs or lack the skills and confidence to talk about and/or address mental health during routine visits. This study aims to co-design and test an evidence-based approach to mental health conversations at the point-of-care in home and community settings with older adults, family and friend caregivers and health and social care providers that could facilitate help-seeking activities and care access.Methods and analysis A participatory mixed-methods study design will be applied, guided by a Working Group of experts-by-experience (n=30). Phase 1 engages ageing Canadians in four online workshops (n=60) and a national survey (n=1000) to adapt an evidence-based visual model of mental health for use with older adults in home and community care. Phase 2 includes six co-design workshops with community providers (n=90) in rural and urban sites across three Canadian provinces to co-design tools, resources and processes for enabling the use of the adapted model as a conversation guide. Phase 3 involves pilot and feasibility testing the co-designed conversations with older adult clients of providers from Phase 2 (n=180).Ethics and dissemination Phases 1 and 2 of this study have received ethics clearance at the University of Waterloo (ORE #44187), University of British Columbia (#H22-02306) and St. Francis Xavier University (#26075). While an overview of Phase 3 is included, details will rely on Phase 2 outcomes. Knowledge mobilisation activities will include peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, webinars, newsletters, infographics and policy briefs. Interested audiences may include community organisations, policy and decision-makers and health and social care providers.

AB This study developed an information and communication technology-based mobile application to administer cognitive behavioral therapy to community-dwelling older adults with insomnia. First, the content of the application was determined through a systematic review and preference survey. Preference data on the perception, needs, and preference for non-face-to-face service content were collected from 15 July 2021 to 31 August 2021 from 100 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older. In the design stage, the structure and function of the application were determined, and an interface was designed. The application was developed in conjunction with design experts and programmers using Android Studio software (Android 9). Usability tests were conducted during the implementation stage, followed by an evaluation stage. The evaluation revealed that the application's structure and functions should comprise sleep information, sleep-habit improvement, sleep assistance, video, real-time counseling, and exercise services. These elements were finalized after receiving the results of a preference analysis and advice from an advisory panel of experts in different fields. The developed application was rated with a score of four or higher in all areas. This study successfully developed, implemented, and evaluated a new mobile application called Smart Sleep for community-dwelling older adults with insomnia.

AB Background: The healthcare needs of People living with Dementia (PlwD) (such as Alzheimer's disease) are often unmet. Information about the needs of community-dwelling PlwD and their association with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics is needed to fill the knowledge gap regarding factors influencing unmet needs among PlwD and to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment to develop tailored interventions.
   Objective: To describe sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the InDePendent study population with particular reference to determinants of unmet needs.
   Methods: We analyzed baseline data of the multi-centre cluster-randomized controlled trial (InDePendent) using descriptive statistics to describe patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and Poisson regression models to predict unmet needs, separated by sex. Data were collected personally via face-to-face interviews.
   Results: Most of the n = 417 participating PlwD were mild to moderately cognitively impaired, were not depressed, had an average of 10.8 diagnoses, took 6.7 medications, and had, on average, 2.4 unmet needs (62% of PlwD had at least one unmet need) measured by the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly (CANE). Low social support, a high body-mass-index, a lower education, functional impairment, and worse health status were associated with more unmet needs, regardless of sex. In women, higher unmet needs were associated with more depressive symptoms, a poor financial situation, living alone and not being recently treated by a general practitioner. In males, unmet needs increased with the number of medications taken.
   Conclusions: PlwD had a broad array of unmet healthcare needs, indicating primary healthcare provision improvement potentials. The results underscore the significance of early assessment of patient's clinical characteristics and unmet needs as a basis for individualized gender-sensible intervention strategies.

TI Strategies for General Practitioners to Enhance Cancer Care: Insights
   from a Patient-Centered Questionnaire Survey in Southern China

LA English
DT Article

AB Background: The incidence of cancer is increasing, and cancer survivors are also growing exponentially. Cancer is defined as a new chronic disease. Nevertheless, the management of cancer in the form of chronic diseases in China is still in its infancy, without a standardized care model. Objective: This study aimed to explore the current status of management of cancer care from the patient's perspective. Methods: This cross-sectional study was a questionnaire survey of patients diagnosed with cancer, including information of the current situation of daily medical consultation, status of comorbidity, and expectations of seeking cancer care in future. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to explore the factors influencing patients' choice of cancer management mode. Results: A total of 200 cancer patients were included in the study. The majority (n = 150) of cancer patients chose an oncologist in a tertiary hospital for cancer care. Difficulty in registration (45%), time-consuming (34.5%), repeated examinations (34.5%) and different treatment opinions (12.0%) were the main difficulties they encountered currently during tertiary hospital visits. In community hospital, lack of trust in general practitioners (n = 33) and the necessary drugs or testing items in community hospitals (n = 47) were the main difficulties during their visits. Logistic regression analysis showed that male (OR = 2.737, 95% CI, 1.332-5.627, p = 0.006) and elderly patients (OR = 3.186, 95% CI, 1.172-8.661, p = 0.023) were more likely to choose general practitioners (GPs) in community hospitals. Twenty-nine (14.5%) patients hope to have an integrated multidisciplinary management in tertiary and community hospitals with the active participation of GPs for cancer care. Conclusion: Improving drug availability, equipment and quality of cancer care services can help to increase cancer patients' recognition of community hospital. In addition, the multidisciplinary management integrated tertiary hospitals and communities with the participation of GPs is a worth exploring mode that improves the management of cancer care.

AB Objective The escalating global aging population underscores the need to effectively manage geriatric diseases, constituting a significant public health concern. Community-based rehabilitation has emerged as a crucial and accessible paradigm for the rehabilitation of older adults. In China, however, the practical implementation of community-based rehabilitation faces formidable challenges, including a dearth of specialized rehabilitation therapists, substantial disparities between demand and supply, and suboptimal satisfaction rates. We aimed to develop a community-based rehabilitation management platform for older adults centered around digital health technology, with the plan to conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial to gather more evidence to explore the best practices and service models of community-based rehabilitation based on digital health technology.Methods This cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Zunyi City, China. We will recruit 286 adults aged >= 60 years and randomly allocate 20 subdistricts in a 1:1 ratio into either the intervention group, which will use the Rehabilitation Journey application, or the control group, which will be given a Rehabilitation Information Booklet for Older Adults. Both groups will undergo a 12-month rehabilitation management program, encompassing six months of guidance and an additional six months of follow-up through online and offline methods. The evaluation indicators will be assessed at enrollment and at 3rd, 6th, and 12th month.Discussion This study endeavors to furnish novel insights to develop a tailored community-based rehabilitation management program for older adults, delivering customized, intelligent, and precise rehabilitation services.

AB Background The role of visiting health services has been proven to be effective in promoting the health of older populations. Hence, developing a web system for nurses may help improve the quality of visiting health services for community-dwelling frail older adults. This study was conducted to develop a web application that reflects the needs of visiting nurses.Methods Visiting nurses of public health centers and community centers in South Korea participated in the design and evaluation process. Six nurses took part in the focus group interviews, and 21 visiting nurses and community center managers participated in the satisfaction evaluation. Focus group interviews were conducted to identify the needs of visiting nurses with respect to system function. Based on the findings, a web application that can support the effective delivery of home visiting services in the community was developed. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm was also developed to recommend health and welfare services according to each patient's health status. After development, a structured survey was conducted to evaluate user satisfaction with system features using Kano's model.Results The new system can be used with mobile devices to increase the mobility of visiting nurses. The system includes 13 features that support the management of patient data and enhance the efficiency of visiting services (e.g., map, navigation, scheduler, protocol archives, professional advice, and online case conferencing). The user satisfaction survey revealed that nurses showed high satisfaction with the system. Among all features, the nurses were most satisfied with the care plan, which included AI-based recommendations for community referral.Conclusions The system developed from the study has attractive features for visiting nurses and supports their essential tasks. The system can help with effective case management for older adults requiring in-home care and reduce nurses' workload. It can also improve communication and networking between healthcare and long-term care institutions.

AB Background: The need for digital literacy in aging populations is increasing in the digitalizing society. Digital literacy involves the identification, evaluation, and communication of information through various digital devices or relevant programs.
   Objective: The aims of this study were to develop an Everyday Digital Literacy Questionnaire (EDLQ), a digital literacy assessment scale, and subsequently evaluate its psychometric properties using a population of community-dwelling older adults in South Korea.
   Methods: The EDLQ was developed using an instrument development design. A nationwide survey was conducted, and the study included 1016 community-dwelling older adults (age >= 60 years). To evaluate the psychometric properties, the participants were randomly divided into 2 groups (n=508 each), and the internal consistency (Cronbach alpha and McDonald omega), structural validity (exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis), hypothesis-testing construct validity using the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS), and measurement invariance were analyzed.
   Results: Among the initial 30 items of the EDLQ, 22 items with a 3-factor solution had a total explained variance of 77%. The domains included "information and communication" (9 items), "content creation and management" (4 items), and "safety and security" (9 items). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with this 3-factor solution (chi(2)(206)=345.1; normed chi(2)(206)=1.7; comparative fit index=0.997; Tucker-Lewis index=0.997; root-mean-square error of approximation=0.036; standardized root-mean-square residual=0.050; composite reliability=0.903-0.959; average variance extracted=0.699-0.724; R-2=0.616-0.773). Hypothesis-testing construct validity with the eHEALS revealed a strong correlation (r=0.75). Cronbach alpha and McDonald omega coefficients were .98 and 0.98, respectively. The fit indices for measurement invariance, including the configural, metric, and scalar invariance models, demonstrated a satisfactory fit to the data. Our findings suggest that the psychometric properties of the 22-item EDLQ are valid and reliable for assessing digital literacy among older Korean adults.
   Conclusions: In this study, we developed a digital literacy measure with strong psychometric properties that made it suitable for assessing the digital literacy of community-dwelling older adults in Korea. To broaden its applicability, however, further assessment of its feasibility for use with different languages and cultures is necessary. Moreover, more empirical research on digital literacy and related factors in older adults can facilitate the development of personalized digital health care services and educational interventions in the digital society.

AB IntroductionIn the context of the digital economy, the emergence and application of emerging technologies have accelerated the integration of traditional social structures with new technologies, leading to the inception of the "Future Community" as an innovative urban unit. With an aging population's rapid and sustained rise, integrating health care for older adults with modern information technology is gradually moving towards holistic governance. This approach utilizes the Future Community as a medium and aims for quality enhancement and increased efficiency, which instrumentally addresses the diversified health care needs of China's aging era.MethodsIn this study, we employed a questionnaire survey method that covered 11 communities in Tianjin City to understand better the current status and characteristics of their health care services.ResultsThe survey results show that the means of community health care for older adults are gradually being upgraded, and the demands are shifting. Then, we arrive at three conclusions: firstly, technological innovation and smart approaches have the potential to positively influence the quality of health care in these communities. Secondly, allocating health care resources within communities can have a salutary effect on the psychological well-being of seniors. Thirdly, actively involving seniors in community life and governance can elevate their self-worth.DiscussionAt last, in conjunction with current challenges, we think that deepening multi-party collaboration, educating specialized talents, and bridging the "digital gap" would be effective ways to establish a future community for seniors.

AB ObjectiveLimited information is available on the effect of hypertriglyceridemic waist-to-height ratio (HTHWH) and hypertension-diabetes comorbidity (HAD) in older adult people. We aimed to explore the relationship between HTHWH and HAD for the co-management of hypertension and diabetes mellitus in the older adult.MethodsA cross-sectional study, randomized cluster sampling from 10 community health service centers, and multivariate logistic regression were used in this study. A total of 3,501 participants aged 65 years or older recruited between January 2019 and December 2019 completed the study.ResultsAmong 3,501 participants, the median age was 69.96 years, and 42.50% were men. A total of 1,207 subjects were in the HTHWH group, and the prevalence rate of HAD was 17.23% in this group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, as compared with the normal group, the risk of HAD in the HTHWH group increased by 2.05 times (OR = 3.05, 95% CI: 2.06-4.51). The risks of hypertension or diabetes mellitus (HOD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were also increased in the HTHWH group, with their ORs (95%CIs) being 1.82 (1.44-2.29), 1.73 (1.38-2.17), and 2.28 (1.66-3.13), respectively.ConclusionHTHWH significantly increases the risk of HAD and can be used as a reliable tool to screen the high-risk population for HAD.

AB Objective: To describe the local adaptation of the Pathways to Community Living (PCLI) program in an Older Peoples Mental Health (OPMH) service to guide other services.
   Method: A retrospective observational study was conducted. Data were obtained from service planning meetings and newly developed documents, Clinical Advisory Committee meetings, and OPMH PCLI database.
   Results: The PCLI program was adapted for the local OPMH service through development of an assessment template, creating a Memorandum of Understanding with a partner Residential Aged Care Facility (RACF) and establishing processes for collaboration and regular review. Between 2019 and March 2023, 20 mental health consumers were referred to the OPMH PCLI program. Their demographic and clinical characteristics are described.
   Conclusions: Adaptation of the PCLI program for OPMH consumers required consideration of specific older adult needs to develop a bespoke plan for assessment and partnership with the PCLI-funded RACF. The development phase and ongoing processes for review facilitated engagement of key stakeholders across health and RACF sectors, highlighting issues with consumer engagement. Similar models could be used by other health services to implement the PCLI in their local context.

AB Objectives Community Paramedicine (CP) is increasingly being used to provide chronic disease management for vulnerable populations in the community. CP@clinic took place in social housing buildings to support cardiovascular health and diabetes management for older adults. The purpose of this study was to examine participant perceptions of their experience with CP@clinic as well as potential ongoing programme benefits. Design This descriptive qualitative study used focus groups to understand resident experiences of the CP@clinic programme. Groups were facilitated by experienced moderators using a semistructured guide. An inductive coding approach was used with at least two researchers taking part in each step of the analysis process. Setting Community-based social housing buildings in Ontario, Canada. Participants Forty-one participants from four CP@clinic sites took part in a focus group. Convenience sampling was used with anyone having taken part in a CP@clinic session being eligible to attend the focus group. Results Analysis yielded six themes across two broad areas: timely access to health information and services, support to achieve personal health goals, better understanding of healthcare system (Personal Benefits); and sense of community, comfortable and familiar place to talk about health, facilitated communication between healthcare professionals (Programme Structure). Participants experienced discernible health changes that motivated their participation. CP@clinic was viewed as a programme that created connections within the building and outside of it. Participants were enthusiastic for the continuation of the programme and appreciated the consistent support to meet their health goals. Conclusions CP@clinic was successful in creating a supportive and friendly environment to facilitate health behavioural changes. Ongoing implementation of CP@clinic would allow residents to continue to build their chronic disease management knowledge and skills.

AB Intergenerational integration has given rise to a novel aging paradigm known as all-age communities, which is garnering international attention. In China, the aging population and the implementation of the three-child policy have resulted in increased demand for retirement and childcare services among residents in older neighborhoods. Consequently, there is a pressing need to retrofit these older neighborhoods to accommodate all-age living arrangements given the high demand they generate. Therefore, this study undertakes research interviews with residents and constructs an exploratory theoretical model rooted in established theory. To assess the significance of our model, we employ Smart PLS 3.0 based on 297 empirical data points. Our findings indicate that anxiety has a significant negative effect on payment behavior; objective perception, willingness to pay, and government assistance exert significant positive effects on payment behavior. By comprehensively analyzing the mechanisms underlying residents' payment behavior, this study provides valuable insights for the government for promoting the aging process within communities and formulating effective transformation policies.

AB In the United States, 21.5% of individuals aged 5 or older speak a language other than English at home and 8.2% have Limited English Proficiency (LEP). LEP individuals experience healthcare disparities, including lower access to healthcare services, poorer health outcomes, and higher levels of uninsurance. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted and exacerbated these health disparities and unmet healthcare needs. In Alameda County (CA), where 46% of foreign-born residents speak a language other than English at home, community-based organizations have been crucial in providing translated materials and one-on-one support to ensure LEP residents receive critical COVID-19 updates and services. Refugee and Immigrant Collaborative for Empowerment (RICE) is a multilingual coalition of seven Alameda County community-based organizations led by the Korean Community Center of the East Bay (KCCEB). During the COVID-19 pandemic, RICE expanded its public health role to fill service and information gaps, advocate on behalf of LEP groups, and build a linguistically and culturally responsive public health safety network. This community case study describes a three-part advocacy-focused intervention that RICE undertook from September 2021 to October 2022. It included (1) a community needs survey, (2) a landscape assessment of the Alameda County Health Department's (ACPHD) communication materials and online platforms, and (3) relationship building with the ACPHD. The community survey revealed differences across LEP subgroups and highlighted the importance of gathering data disaggregated by language preference. The landscape assessment allowed RICE to understand the ACPHD's decision-making process and develop data-informed advocacy requests on behalf of LEP communities. Effective communication and coordination between RICE and the ACPHD shortened the feedback loop between public health authorities and LEP communities and laid the groundwork for the RICE organizations to be part of the ACPHD's future decision making. Data disaggregation, language equity-based advocacy, and cross-sector collaboration were critical ingredients in RICE's intervention. RICE's partnership and relationship of mutual accountability with the ACPHD may provide a useful model for other community-based organizations and public health departments seeking to form similar partnerships.

AB In recent years, the accelerated aging process in China has brought enormous pressure on the traditional aged care system. The private family-based aged care mode cannot resolve the contradiction between the insufficient labor force and a large elderly population. The public community-based aged care mode could effectively integrate various social resources such as housing, healthcare, land, education, etc., which may better meet diverse elderly care demands. The senior residents' evaluation of public aged care services is essential for local pension policy making, determining the local government's investment direction to some extent. Therefore, this research organizes a decision group to conduct the evaluation of alternative aged care service projects with Maslow's hierarchy-based evaluation framework. The decision group consists of senior citizens from the Xiaolingwei community in Nanjing, which is a deeply aging metropolis with the flourishing aged care service market and demand. Considering the aged residents' inherent preference differences rooted in living habits, cultural background, and risk attitude, it is essential to introduce an effective consensus model into the group evaluation to control opinion conflict and reach consensus. The current consensus models still have the following limitations: consensus models depend on the preset empirical consensus threshold, hardly reflecting the spontaneous consensus emergence; the inconsistency of group consensus opinion harms the reliability and effectiveness of group decision; the existing methods generally identify the non-cooperative behavior passively, lacking the adaptive and active management. Therefore, this paper develops the consensus emergence model driven by the social learning mechanism based on the BA scale-free network and the Bayesian learning rule, guiding the selfadaptive opinion evolution and the spontaneous consensus convergence. The novel consensus model includes three crucial parts: the environment network construction, the private cognition formation, and the individual preference modification. The proposed consensus emergence model has outstanding advantages in consensus consistency through spontaneous opinion evolution, the adaptive consensus emergence with greater consensus efficiency, and the consensus robustness under non-cooperators disturbance.

AB Background and objectives: Previous research has identified numerous benefits of information and communication technology (ICT) on the well-being of older adults. However, it has been increasingly recognized that older adults do not necessarily catch up with the rapidly digitalized society, known as the 'age-based digital divide'. The progress of digitalization has been accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have widened the digital divide. This study aimed to gain a better understanding of their living experience and concerns about digital exclusion during the pandemic. The perceptions of older adults in Hong Kong, a highly digitalized, metropolitan city, towards the digital age and its impact on their daily living during the COVID-19 pandemic were explored.Research design and methods: We conducted 12 focus group interviews with 77 community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, applying both organization, reduction, and refinement.Results: Four themes were identified: 1) Diversified means to access community information; 2) Facilitated daily living through the usage of ICTs; 3) Concerns about age-related decline in function; and 4) Fear of digital exclusion and accelerated digitalization during the pandemic. The results indicate that ICT provided numerous benefits to the daily life of older adults, but our participants also expressed concerns about age-related losses and the fear of digital exclusion due to the ongoing digitalization of society.Discussion and implications: Our findings indicated that older adults do not necessarily benefit from technological innovations, which are becoming more pervasive during the pandemic. To create age-friendly environments that cater to the needs of all members of society in the digital age, policymakers and service providers should provide diverse choices for older adults, rather than relying solely on one-size-fits-all technological solutions.

AB BackgroundThe Community Paramedicine at Home (CP@home) program is a health promotion program where community paramedics conduct risk assessments with frequent 9-1-1 callers in their homes, with a goal of reducing the frequency of 9-1-1 calls in this vulnerable population. The effectiveness of the CP@home program was investigated through a community-based RCT conducted in four regions in Ontario, Canada. The purpose of this current recruitment study is to examine the challenges met when recruiting for a community randomized control trial on high frequency 9-1-1 callers.MethodsEligible participants were recruited from one of four regions participating in the CP@home program and were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 1142) or control group (n = 1142). Data were collected during the recruitment process from the administrative database of the four paramedic services. Whether they live alone, their parental ethnicity, age, reason for calling 9-1-1, reason for not participating, contact method, and whether they were successfully contacted were recorded. Statistical significance was calculated using the Chi-Squared Test and Fisher's Exact Test to evaluate the effectiveness of the recruitment methods used to enroll eligible participants in the CP@home Program.ResultsOf the people who were contacted, 48.0% answered their phone when called and 53.9% answered their door when a home visit was attempted. In Total, 110 (33.1%) of people where a contact attempt was successful participated in the CP@home program. Most participants were over the age of 65, even though people as young as 18 were contacted. Older adults who called 9-1-1 for a lift assist were more likely to participate, compared to any other individual reason recorded, and were most often recruited through a home visit.ConclusionsThis recruitment analysis successfully describes the challenges experienced by researchers when recruiting frequent 9-1-1 callers, which are considered a hard-to-reach population. The differences in age, contact method, and reason for calling 9-1-1 amongst people contacted and participants should be considered when recruiting this population for future research.

AB Korea has significantly lower life satisfaction than other countries, with older adults reporting the lowest levels among all the age groups. Social isolation from the COVID-19 pandemic put older adults at a higher risk of depression. This study examined the awareness and use of mental health welfare centers among Korean older adults and how the use of these centers impacted life satisfaction and depression during the pandemic. The sample included data from 545 Korean older adults from the 2020 Seoul Welfare Survey. The current analyses included correlations, multivariate linear regression, and Hayes PROCESS macro. Among participants, 9.6% used community mental health centers, and 57.3% were unaware of their existence. Depression was positively associated with life satisfaction among older adults, indicating that participants may experience depression while objectively evaluating their life with satisfactory results. The use of these centers did not emerge as a mediator between depression and life satisfaction during the pandemic. Recommendations included further research into this area, raising awareness of mental health treatment options, reducing stigma toward mental health problems, and improving life satisfaction in depressed older adults via a strengths-based approach.

AB BackgroundVietnam is one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world and the likelihood that someone may have dementia rises dramatically as the population ages. Although caring for persons living with dementia is important, little is known about the circumstances under which community healthcare professionals in Vietnam provide dementia care. This study aimed to describe the practice of caring for persons with dementia among community healthcare professionals in Vietnam.MethodsThis qualitative descriptive study was conducted with 23 community healthcare professionals recruited from 10 primary healthcare centers, representing 10 of 24 districts in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Participants were physicians (n = 11), physician's assistants (n = 8) and community nurses (n = 4). Data were collected through in-depth face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Interview data were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using content analysis.ResultsThe mean age of the 23 participants was 44.6 & PLUSMN; 8.8 years; most were female (n = 16, 69.6%); and the mean time of working in the field of dementia care was 15.9 & PLUSMN; 8.4 years. Analysis of the interview data revealed five categories, which informed how care was provided: 1) Knowledge about dementia and its prevalence among older adults; 2) Identification of dementia in Vietnam; 3) Lack of attention to early diagnosis of dementia and difficulty in providing continuous care; 4) Dependence on family members for prompt and continuous care; and 5) challenges to providing dementia care. Despite having knowledge about dementia, some healthcare professionals incorrectly viewed dementia as an inevitable part of the ageing process. Participants reported that their limited training and practical experience in caring for persons with dementia caused a lack of confidence in dementia care.ConclusionsThe quality of care provided to persons living with dementia was negatively impacted by the limited training of healthcare personnel. The diagnosis, treatment, and provision of supportive services to persons living with dementia and their families are substantial challenges for the Vietnamese healthcare system. It is crucial to initiate and cultivate dementia care education programs aimed at expanding curricula for physicians, physicians' assistants, and nurses.

AB The profound changes in China's population, economy and social structure have significantly impacted traditional home-based aged care and social welfare, leading to the emergence of Aged Care Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects for institutional care. Social sustainability is crucial for these projects as it greatly improves stakeholders' quality of life and well-being. Adoption of social sustainability practices enhances elderly and employee satisfaction, offers competitive advantages, and fosters community development. This study aimed to establish a socially sustainable development process for aged care PPP projects. A multiple case study was conducted, and an improved critical incident technique was adopted. Forty-two first-level critical practices that should be adopted by government departments, private investors and Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) at different stages in the lifecycle were identified from three main cases and seventeen parallel reference cases. Twenty-one realisation paths and a consolidated realisation path were established based on analysing the enabling relationships between critical practices. The preparation phase is pivotal, with ten of the 21 more important critical practices (i.e., critical practices that appear in all realisation paths) adopted at this phase. The behaviours and decisions of government departments played a key and decisive role, with eighteen more important critical practices adopted by them alone. This study contributes to enhancing knowledge of social sustainability in aged care. The critical practices and the realisation paths provide a complete picture of realising social sustainability of aged care PPP projects. The public and private sectors can adopt corresponding behaviours and decisions at different project stages to deliver projects successfully. The empirical data shows the applicability of stakeholder theory in social sustainability research on aged care. In addition, the results provide insights into the achievement of social sustainability of aged care projects in other countries and the understanding of social sustainability of other public service projects. However, potential biases exist in the study, arising from considering aged care PPP projects as a whole, neglecting lessons from failure cases, and subjective judgments in qualitative research.

AB BackgroundLong term care (LTC) services for functionally impaired senior citizens are crucial for addressing the challenges of aging. However, research on eligibility criteria and coverage of LTC in China is lacking. Our objective is to assess the current status of LTC and explore eligibility criteria and coverage for the elderly.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional study conducted in two first-tier cities in China. Residents aged 65 or over were recruited from a nursing home and four primary hospitals. Participants were divided into three groups (bedridden, domestic, and community), then six grades (grade one to six) according to the Longshi Scale, and their functional ability was assessed using the Modified Barthel Index. Information such as diseases, complications, and daily care needs were collected. Nursing staff were invited to indicate patients' needs for care. A one-way ANOVA test, Kruskal Wallis H test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to explore the differences of variables in three Longshi groups or Longshi grades.ResultsAmong all 1157 participants, with an average age of 80.54, 69.3% were in the bedridden group. The most common diagnosis was stroke (71.4%), with the most prevalent complication being pulmonary infection (25.2%). In the nursing assessment, basic health care, disease care, activity care, complication prevention care and psychosocial care were summarized as the five main aspects of LTC for the elderly. Feeding, bathing, drinking, bowel management and bladder management were identified as the basic care which fulfills participants' basic physical needs in each Longshi group. Mouth care, artificial airway management, and body reposition, which can prevent immobility complications, were highly demanded by bedridden elderly.ConclusionsThe elderly in grade one to three are the ones in need of LTC most. The content of LTC for elderly should include basic care which fulfills their basic physical needs and complication care which can prevent immobility complications. The evidence of this research may contribute to the design of LTC in China.Trial registrationThe study design was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-2000034067, Registered 22 Jun 2020, http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=54770).

AB Purpose To explore perspectives of participants in the WISEWOMAN program in Pennsylvania (PA-WISE) on challenges and facilitators of reducing cardiovascular disease risk as low-income and un-/under-insured middle-aged women.Approach Researchers conducted this 2 year qualitative data collection as one component of a broader, 5 year PA-WISE process and outcome evaluation.Setting Women from across Pennsylvania, primarily from rural communities.Participants Interviewees were low-income, un-/under-insured women aged 40-64 years who had recently participated in PA-WISE-facilitated health coaching and lifestyle programs (HC/LSPs).Methods - data collection and analysis Researchers conducted individual telephone interviews with 38 women from four discrete samples of PA-WISE participants at 4 time points. Three researchers used grounded theory, and an iterative process of line-by-line coding, data display, and reanalysis to identify emerging themes, sub-themes, and their relationships.Results Participants shared the important benefits of specific PA-WISE program traits. However, participants described significant financial constraints, difficult schedules, caregiving responsibilities, and insufficient social support as persistent challenges in their lives, making lifestyle changes in general, and program participation specifically, difficult.Conclusion The challenges that low-income and un-/under-insured women identified amplify the importance of having interventions that offer flexibility, options, and tailoring of supports and resources. The timeless challenges articulated by participants in this study completed just before the COVID-19 pandemic, remain relevant to be addressed through the pandemic and beyond.

AB Background: Loneliness poses a significant threat to the quality of life of older adults. Therefore, it is essential to implement non-face-to-face services to solve the loneliness of older adults in the community. Objectives: This study used the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) model to develop mobile applications as a loneliness intervention for older adults living in the community. Methods: A mobile application was developed using the ADDIE model to alleviate loneliness in older adults living in the community. The development process included a systematic review, a face-to-face preference survey, and an experts' evaluation. From 11 to 15 June 2021, the following six databases were used to search for related articles: Ovid-Medline, Ovid-EMBASE, Cochrane Library, KISS, Korea Med, RISS. A preference analysis was conducted on 100 adults aged 65 or older living in the community from 15 July to 31 August 2021. Results: A mobile application for community-dwelling older adults was developed. Its contents included emotional support, cognition, physical activity, health data, nutrition, and motivation. They were organized through a systematic review and preference survey in the analysis stage. They were also designed as main menus and sub-content at the design stage. They also designed the structure, functionality, and interface layout. The application was developed by integrating the designed content and determining the operating system, language, access method, privacy, and server history. Then, experts evaluated the validity of the application. Conclusions: The prototype mobile application incorporates emotional support, cognition, physical activity, health data, nutrition, and motivation. It is expected to help older adults achieve their goals by promoting participation. By incorporating expert validity into the content development process of early prototypes, we have improved the usability and acceptability of our products. Future pilot trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this mobile application among older adults.

AB The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has revolutionized the provision of health services, often referred to as eHealth, benefiting community pharmacies that can offer new services in innovative formats, namely through telepharmacy. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of pharmacy professionals (i.e., pharmacists and pharmacy technicians) on the provision of new services. The study consisted of administering an online questionnaire to pharmacy professionals nationwide. The questionnaire was developed by the research team, based on focus group methodology, from which an inductive analysis led to the categories that made up the dimensions of the survey. Participants were 95 pharmacy professionals with a mean age of 33.69 years old (SD = 10.75). Almost 79% were women. The results show overall receptivity to the development of new services in community pharmacies. Suggestions for the development of the new services, conditions necessary for their implementation, potential obstacles, and strategies to promote adherence to the new services, among others, are identified. The knowledge thus acquired will help community pharmacies to develop innovative solutions in counselling, pharmacotherapy monitoring, and pharmacovigilance, for example, of herb/dietary supplement-drug adverse reactions and interactions. Based on this information, new services can become more accessible, namely through the use of ICTs.

AB Background Incidence and prevalence do not capture the risk of developing diabetes during a defined period and only limited evidence exists on the lifetime risk of diabetes based on longer and continuous follow-up studies in India. Lacunae in evidence on lifetime risk can be attributed primarily to the absence of comprehensive and reliable information on diabetes incidence, mortality rates and lack of longitudinal studies in India. In light of the scarcity of evidence in India, the objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of diabetes and its lifetime risk in an urban community of Mumbai.
   Methods The research study utilized data which is extracted from the electronic medical records of beneficiaries covered under the Contributory Health Service Scheme in Mumbai. The dataset included information on 1652 beneficiaries aged 40 years and above who were non-diabetic in 2011-2012, capturing their visit dates to medical center and corresponding laboratory test results over a span ten years from January, 2012-December, 2021. Survival analysis techniques are applied to estimate the incidence of diabetes. Subsequently, the remaining life years from the life table were utilized to estimate the lifetime risk of diabetes for each gender, stratified by age group.
   Results A total of 546 beneficiaries developed diabetes in ten years, yielding an unadjusted incidence rate of 5.3 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 4.9-5.8 cases/ 1000 person years). The age-adjusted lifetime risk of developing type II diabetes in this urban community is estimated to be 40.3%. Notably, males aged 40 years and above had 41.5% chances of developing diabetes in their lifetime as compared to females with a risk of 39.4%. Moreover, the remaining lifetime risk of diabetes decreased with advancing age, ranging from 26.4% among 40-44 years old to 4.2% among those age 70 years and above.
   Conclusion The findings stress the significance of recognizing age specific lifetime risk and implementing early interventions to prevent or delay diabetes onset and to focus on diabetes management programs in India.

AB IntroductionCognitive phenotyping is a widely used approach to characterize the heterogeneity of deficits in patients with a range of neurological disorders but has only recently been applied to patients with epilepsy. In this study, we identify cognitive phenotypes in older adults with late-onset epilepsy (LOE) and examine their demographic, clinical, and vascular profiles. Further, we examine whether specific phenotypes pose an increased risk for progressive cognitive decline.MethodsParticipants were part of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), a prospective longitudinal community-based cohort study of 15,792 individuals initially enrolled in 1987-1989. LOE was identified from linked Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims data. Ninety-one participants with LOE completed comprehensive testing either prior to or after seizure onset as part of a larger cohort in the ARIC Neurocognitive Study in either 2011-2013 or 2016-2017 (follow-up mean = 4.9 years). Cognitive phenotypes in individuals with LOE were derived by calculating test-level impairments for each participant (i.e., & LE;1 SD below cognitively normal participants on measures of language, memory, and executive function/processing speed); and then assigning participants to phenotypes if they were impaired on at least two tests within a domain. The total number of impaired domains was used to determine the cognitive phenotypes (i.e., Minimal/No Impairment, Single Domain, or Multidomain).ResultsAt our baseline (Visit 5), 36.3% met criteria for Minimal/No Impairment, 35% for Single Domain Impairment (with executive functioning/ processing speed impaired in 53.6%), and 28.7% for Multidomain Impairment. The Minimal/No Impairment group had higher education and occupational complexity. There were no differences in clinical or vascular risk factors across phenotypes. Of those participants with longitudinal data (Visit 6; n = 24), 62.5% declined (i.e., progressed to a more impaired phenotype) and 37.5% remained stable. Those who remained stable were more highly educated compared to those that declined.DiscussionOur results demonstrate the presence of identifiable cognitive phenotypes in older adults with LOE. These results also highlight the high prevalence of cognitive impairments across domains, with deficits in executive function/processing speed the most common isolated impairment. We also demonstrate that higher education was associated with a Minimal/No Impairment phenotype and lower risk for cognitive decline over time.

AB BackgroundRoutine eye examinations achieve several health objectives, including mitigation of sight-threatening risk factors. However, there are barriers to service uptake. Through the qualitative approach, a deeper understanding of these barriers can be realised and enhanced strategies designed to improve the uptake of the routine eye examination. A qualitative study was conducted to identify the factors influencing the decision-making process of older adults to use the routine eye examination service.MethodsThis study was guided by the grounded theory approach. Participants were purposively recruited from six community elderly centres. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or above in Hong Kong. Data were transcribed and constant comparison techniques were used for data analysis.ResultsDifficulty in prioritising and including the routine eye examination in the existing health service utilisation was the central theme associated with its lower use. Four sub-themes were identified to explain this phenomenon: (1) previous health care service utilisation as a reference for judging primary eye care; (2) low perceived primary eye care service needs; (3) low perceived self-efficacy on routine eye care utilisation; (4) service expectations.ConclusionMultiple modifiable factors influence decision-making by older adults, suggesting that their routine eye care seeking behaviour might be altered through behaviour change intervention. The context in which services are delivered requires further study, with a focus on exploring the factors influencing service experience and its subsequent impact on regular eye care seeking behaviour.

AB BackgroundRapid population aging in China means it is imperative to establish a comprehensive care service system for older people. Currently, China is vigorously promoting the development of community care services for older people which should, ideally, focus on psychological health in addition to physical health. This study examined the impact of community care services on older people's psychological health. MethodsSurvey data (n = 741) were collected from people aged 60 years and older in Liaoning Province, China, in which various community care services for older people were provided. Information was collected regarding the types of services provided (e.g., meal services, medical and social care), participants' demographic details (age, gender, economic circumstances, etc.), and their psychological health (e.g., loneliness, life satisfaction). The impact of the various care services on older people's psychological health was subsequently examined through the construction of a structural equation model. ResultsCommunity care services for older people had a significant positive impact on their psychological health, with the most significant positive impact on cultural and sports activities, visiting and chat services, and emotional counseling. The impact of community care services on sub-groups of older people (e.g., those who were disabled, socially isolated and/or poor) was different. ConclusionIt is necessary to provide comprehensive and high-quality community care services, organize diverse cultural, sports, and recreational activities, provide differentiated and specific services for older people, and formulate corresponding service guidelines.

AB Background. Chronic health conditions and socioeconomic problems that affect the well-being and life expectancy of older adults are common. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to analyze the association between sociodemographic variables, oral conditions, and general health and the biomarkers of older adults using machine learning (ML).Methods. A total of 15,068 surveys from the national study of Health, Well-Being and Aging (Salud, Bienestar y Envejecimiento) data set were used for this secondary analysis. Of these, 3,128 people provided blood samples for the analysis of blood biomarkers. Sociodemographic, oral health, and general health variables were analyzed using ML and logistic regression.Results. The results of clustering analysis showed that dyslipidemia was associated with poor oral condition, lower socioeconomic status, being female, and low education. The self-perception of oral health in older adults was not associated with the presence of teeth, blood biomarkers, or socioeconomic variables. However, the necessity of replacing a dental prosthesis was associated with the lowest self-perception of oral health. Edentulism was associated with being female, increased age, and smoking.Conclusions. Socioeconomic and educational disparities, sex, and smoking are important factors for tooth loss and suboptimal blood biomarkers in older adults. ML is a powerful tool for identifying potential variables that may aid in the prevention of systemic and oral diseases in older adults, which would improve geriatric dentistry.Practical Implications. These findings can help the academic community identify critical sociodemographic and clinical factors that influence the process of healthy aging and serve as a useful guide to enhance health care policies and geriatric oral health care services.

AB Initiating end-of-life conversations can be daunting for clinicians and overwhelming for patients and families. This leads to delays in communicating prognosis and preparing for the inevitable in old age, often generating potentially harmful overtreatment and poor-quality deaths. We aimed to develop an electronic resource, called Communicating Health Alternatives Tool (CHAT) that was compatible with hospital medical records software to facilitate preparation for shared decision-making across health settings with older adults deemed to be in the last year of life.The project used mixed methods including: literature review, user-directed specifications, web-based interface development with authentication and authorization; clinician and consumer co-design, iterative consultation for user testing; and ongoing developer integration of user feedback. An internet-based conversation guide to facilitate clinician-led advance care planning was co-developed covering screening for short-term risk of death, patient values and preferences, and treatment choices for chronic kidney disease and dementia. Printed summary of such discussion could be used to begin the process in hospital or community health services. Clinicians, pa-tients, and caregivers agreed with its ease of use and were generally accepting of its contents and format. CHAT is available to health services for implementation in effectiveness trials to determine whether the interaction and documentation leads to formal decision-making, goal-concordant care, and subsequent reduction of unwanted treatments at the end of life.

AB Introduction: Well-integrated community aged care services empower and enable older people to live and thrive in the community by supporting activities of daily living. To inform integrated community aged care service planning and delivery in South Western Sydney Australia, a needs assessment with consumers (i.e., older people), their caregivers, and healthcare providers was conducted. This study details the comprehensive and inclusive needs assessment process undertaken, with a focus on translating the findings into practice to improve integrated care.Description: Qualitative interviews and community forum-style focus groups engaged 160 stakeholders including GPs, older people, and aged care workers. Transcribed data were thematically coded using an inductive approach. Data were organised into four themes: 1) access to community aged care services; (2) healthcare and medical needs; (3) social concerns and needs; and (4) education and information needs.Discussion: The needs assessment undertaken identified unmet needs, gaps in service provision, and recommendations for improving integrated community aged care services.Conclusion: Findings are novel in the context of South Western Sydney, Australia. The study design, methods employed, and lessons learned can be adapted internationally for future needs assessments to inform policy, strategies, and integrated aged care service delivery.

AB BackgroundThe government of Ethiopia has envisioned digitalizing primary healthcare units through the electronic community health information system (eCHIS) program as a re-engineering strategy aiming to improve healthcare data quality, use, and service provision. The eCHIS is intended as a community-wide initiative to integrate lower health structure with higher administrative health and service delivery unit with the ultimate goal of improving community health. However, the success or failure of the program depends on the level of identifying enablers and barriers of the implementation. Therefore, this study aimed to explore individual and contextual-level enablers and barriers determining eCHIS implementation.MethodWe conducted an exploratory study to determine the enablers and barriers to successfully implementing eCHIS in rural Wogera district, northwest Ethiopia. In-depth interviews and key informant interviews were applied at participants from multiple sites. A thematic content analysis was conducted based on the key themes reported. We applied the five components of consolidated framework for implementation research to interpret the findings.ResultsFirst, based on the intervention's characteristics, implementers valued the eCHIS program. However, its implementation was impacted by the heavy workload, limited or absent network and electricity. Outer-setting challenges were staff turnover, presence of competing projects, and lack of incentive mechanisms. In terms of the inner setting, lack of institutionalization and ownership were mentioned as barriers to the implementation. Resource allocation, community mobilization, leaders' engagement, and availability of help desk need emphasis for a better achievement. With regard to characteristics of the individuals, limited digital literacy, older age, lack of peer-to-peer support, and limited self-expectancy posed challenges to the implementation. Finally, the importance of mentoring and engaging community and religious leaders, volunteers, having defined plan and regular meetings were identified elements of the implementation process and need emphasis.ConclusionThe findings underlined the potential enablers and barriers of eCHIS program for quality health data generation, use, and service provision and highlighted areas that require emphasis for further scale-up. The success and sustainability of the eCHIS require ongoing government commitment, sufficient resource allocation, institutionalization, capacity building, communication, planning, monitoring, and evaluation.

AB BackgroundA significant number of late middle-aged adults with depression have a high illness burden resulting from chronic conditions which put them at high risk of hospitalization. Many late middle-aged adults are covered by commercial health insurance, but such insurance claims have not been used to identify the risk of hospitalization in individuals with depression. In the present study, we developed and validated a non-proprietary model to identify late middle-aged adults with depression at risk for hospitalization, using machine learning methods.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study involved 71,682 commercially insured older adults aged 55-64 years diagnosed with depression. National health insurance claims were used to capture demographics, health care utilization, and health status during the base year. Health status was captured using 70 chronic health conditions, and 46 mental health conditions. The outcomes were 1- and 2-year preventable hospitalization. For each of our two outcomes, we evaluated seven modelling approaches: four prediction models utilized logistic regression with different combinations of predictors to evaluate the relative contribution of each group of variables, and three prediction models utilized machine learning approaches - logistic regression with LASSO penalty, random forests (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM).ResultsOur predictive model for 1-year hospitalization achieved an AUC of 0.803, with a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 76% under the optimum threshold of 0.463, and our predictive model for 2-year hospitalization achieved an AUC of 0.793, with a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 71% under the optimum threshold of 0.452. For predicting both 1-year and 2-year risk of preventable hospitalization, our best performing models utilized the machine learning approach of logistic regression with LASSO penalty which outperformed more black-box machine learning models like RF and GBM.ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the feasibility of identifying depressed middle-aged adults at higher risk of future hospitalization due to burden of chronic illnesses using basic demographic information and diagnosis codes recorded in health insurance claims. Identifying this population may assist health care planners in developing effective screening strategies and management approaches and in efficient allocation of public healthcare resources as this population transitions to publicly funded healthcare programs, e.g., Medicare in the US.

AB ObjectiveThis research identifies practical lessons regarding the delivery of teleyoga. Our objectives are to (1) describe challenges and opportunities experienced by yoga instructors when moving the Successful AGEing (SAGE) yoga programme online, and (2) describe how yoga instructors adapted to manage the challenges and leverage opportunities presented by teleyoga. MethodsThis study is a secondary analysis of the data from a previous realist process evaluation of the SAGE yoga trial. The SAGE yoga trial is testing the effect of a yoga-based exercise programme on falls among 700 community-dwelling people aged 60+ years. We draw on focus groups and interviews with four SAGE yoga instructors which we analysed using previously developed programme theories combined with inductive coding and an analytical workshop. ResultsThe concerns of the yoga instructors about teleyoga can be characterised into four broad issues: threats to safety, altered interpersonal dynamics, facilitating mind-body connection and difficulties with technology. The SAGE instructors identified eight modifications they used to manage these challenges: a 1:1 participant interview prior to programme commencement, more descriptive verbal instructions, increased focus on interoception, increased attention and support, slower more structured class flow, simplifying poses, adapting the studio environment and IT support. ConclusionsWe have created a typology of strategies for addressing challenges in the delivery of teleyoga for older people. As well as maximising engagement with teleyoga, these manageable strategies could be applied by other instructors to a wide range of telehealth classes, improving the uptake and adherence of beneficial online programmes and services.

TI Factors Affecting the Effectiveness of Discharge Planning
   Implementation: A Case-Control Cohort Study

AB BackgroundIn many hospitals, a discharge planning team works with the medical team to provide case management to ensure high-quality patient care and improve continuity of care from the hospital to the community. However, a large-scale database analysis of the effectiveness of overall discharge planning efforts is lacking.PurposeThis study was designed to investigate the clinical factors that impact the efficacy of discharge planning in terms of hospital length of stay, readmission rate, and survival status.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted based on patient medical records and the discharge plans applied to patients hospitalized in a regional medical center between 2017 and 2018. The medical information system database and the care service management information system maintained by the Ministry of Health and Welfare were used to collect data and explore patients' medical care and follow-up status.ResultsClinical factors such as activities of daily living <= 60, having indwelling catheters, having poor control of chronic diseases, and insufficient caregiver capacity were found to be associated with longer hospitalization stays. In addition, men and those with indwelling catheters were found to have a higher risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge. Moreover, significantly higher mortality was found after discharge in men, those >= 75 years old, those with activities of daily living <= 60, those with indwelling catheters, those with pressure ulcers or unclean wounds, those with financial problems, those with caregivers with insufficient capacity, and those readmitted 14-30 days after discharge.ConclusionsThe findings of this study indicate that implementing case management for discharge planning does not substantially reduce the length of hospital stay nor does it affect patients' readmission status or prognosis after discharge. However, age, underlying comorbidities, and specific disease factors decrease the efficacy of discharge planning. Therefore, active discharge planning interventions should be provided to ensure transitional care for high-risk patients.

AB Objective To evaluate the current state of family doctor contract services (FDCS) in Beijing, identify the roles of family doctors who have worked with disabled older adults and investigate the barriers and facilitators faced by family doctors in providing care for them.
   Design A convergent mixed methods study was carried out from October 2020 to January 2021 to collect and analyse both quantitative and qualitative data. The integration strategies in this study were connecting the results of the quantitative phase to data collection of the qualitative phase.
   Setting A multi-stage sampling strategy was used to select 15 community health centres (CHCs) in four districts of Beijing. Of the four districts, two were from urban areas and two were from rural areas.
   Participants The inclusion criteria for participants were (1) family doctors, (2) contracted with disabled older adults, (3) engaged in related work for disabled older adults more than 6 months.
   Methods A cluster sampling of 283 family doctors was used in the questionnaire. A purposive sample of 30 family doctors from the same CHCs was selected during the same period. Frequency and rank, rank-sum test, Kruskal-Wallis test were conducted in qualitative data analysis, the views of the interviewees were analysed through the thematic framework method.
   Results Currently, family doctors provided various services to satisfy the health needs of disabled older adults, while the usage of FDCS for disabled older adults is affected by many factors. The differences of the importance of family doctors' role (p<0.001) and service satisfaction (p=0.004) were significant among four districts. Compared with contracted health senior citizens, this study has identified five unique roles of family doctors, including 'psychological consultant', 'rehabilitation physiotherapist', 'health educator', 'health manager' and 'family health guardian'. Moreover, family doctors are confronted with a myriad of barriers (including high risks in the process of home visits, a lack of supervisory and incentive mechanisms, insufficiency of time and energy, etc) and facilitators (including establishing a doctor-patient trust relationship, developing humanistic care services, etc) in the FDCS for disabled older adults.
   Conclusions Family doctors play a pivotal role in the FDCS for disabled older adults, while the effect and quality of FDCS in China needs to be improved. It is suggested that further research needs to focus on solving existing barriers of FDCS to optimise the health of disabled older adults and improve the quality of their lives.

TI Identifying facilitators and barriers to integrated and equitable care
   for community-dwelling older adults with high emergency department use
   from historically marginalized groups

AB BackgroundHigh rates of emergency department (ED) use by older adults persist despite attempts to improve accessibility of appropriate and comprehensive care. Understanding the drivers of ED visits from the perspective of older adults from historically marginalized groups could help reduce ED use by patients with needs that are preventable or could have been treated in a more appropriate setting. This interpretivist, feminist study aims to explore the unmet care needs of older adults (age 65 +) with high ED use and belonging to historically marginalized groups to better understand how social and structural inequities reinforced by neoliberalism; federal and provincial governance structures and policy frameworks; and regional processes and local institutional practices, shape the experiences of these older adults, particularly those at risk of poor health outcomes based on the social determinants of health (SDH).Methods/designThis mixed methods study will employ an integrated knowledge translation (iKT) approach, starting with a quantitative phase followed by a qualitative phase. Older adults self-identifying as belonging to a historically marginalized group, having visited an ED three or more times in the past 12 months, and living in a private dwelling, will be recruited using flyers posted at two emergency care sites and by an on-site research assistant. Data obtained through surveys, short answer questions, and chart review will be used to compile case profiles of patients from historically marginalized groups with potentially avoidable ED visits. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses and inductive thematic analysis will be conducted. Findings will be interpreted using the Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis Framework to identify the interconnections between unmet care needs, potentially avoidable ED admissions, structural inequalities, and the SDH. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of older adults at risk of poor health outcomes based on SDH, family care partners, and health care professionals to validate preliminary findings and collect additional data on perceived facilitators and barriers to integrated and accessible care.DiscussionExploring the linkages between potentially avoidable ED visits by older adults from marginalized groups and how their care experiences have been shaped by inequities in the systems, policies, and institutions that structure health and social care provision will enable researchers to offer recommendations for equity-focused policy and clinical practice reforms to improve patient outcomes and system integration.

AB Older prisoners are the fasted growing sub group in prisons across developed countries. They have high levels of health and social care needs in relation to their younger counterpart and those of the same age living in the community. There are a lack of interventions to ensure their needs are met. The older prisoner health and social care assessment and plan (OHSCAP) provided a structured process for addressing need and it's effectiveness was evaluated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). This paper presents findings from the nested qualitative study relating to this RCT. The aim of this study was to explore the facilitators and barriers to delivering the OHSCAP. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve staff members delivering the OHSCAP and 14 service users who had received the intervention. The framework method was used to analyse the data produced. Participants described a 'broken' prison system. They discussed a staffing crisis resulting in individuals' human rights being violated, which led to dangerous conditions in the prison. These conditions further impeding the staffing crisis, as recruitment was difficult and staff sickness was high. This 'broken' prison cycle significantly contributed to a lack of adequate attention being paid to OHSCAP processes. The delivery of health and social care interventions in prison is challenging when basic systems relating to staffing and safety are not adequate. Future research needs to consider how these circumstances can be mitigated.

AB Innovative technological solutions are required to improve patients' quality of life and deliver suitable treatment. Healthcare workers may be able to watch patients from a distance using the Internet of Things (IoT) by using big data algorithms to analyze instrument outputs. Therefore, it is essential to gather information on use and health problems in order to improve the remedies. To ensure seamless incorporation for use in healthcare institutions, senior communities, or private homes, these technological tools must first and foremost be easy to use and implement. We provide a network cluster-based system known as smart patient room usage in order to achieve this. As a result, nursing staff or caretakers can use it efficiently and swiftly. This work focuses on the exterior unit that makes up a network cluster, a cloud storage mechanism for data processing and storage, as well as a wireless or unique radio frequency send module for data transfer. In this article, a spatio-temporal cluster mapping system is presented and described. This system creates time series data using sense data collected from various clusters. The suggested method is the ideal tool to use in a variety of circumstances to improve medical and healthcare services. The suggested model's ability to anticipate moving behavior with high precision is its most important feature. The time series graphic displays a regular light movement that continued almost the entire night. The last 12 h' lowest and highest moving duration numbers were roughly 40% and 50%, respectively. When there is little movement, the model assumes a normal posture. Particularly, the moving duration ranges from 7% to 14%, with an average of 7.0%.

AB Objectives: Little is known about determinants of access to community-based geriatricians. The Geriatric 5Ms (TM) describe geriatricians' core competencies and inform referrals to specialists for older adults with complex needs. We explored the association of the Geriatric 5Ms (TM) and other characteristics with outpatient access to geriatricians by home care (HC) clients.Methods: This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study of frail community-dwelling HC clients (= 60 years) with complex needs (n = 196,444). Health assessment information was linked to health services data in Ontario, Canada, 2012-2015. Multivariable generalized estimating equations were used to identify characteristics associated with geriatrician contact (= 1 visit in 90 days post-HC admission), including derived Geriatric 5Ms (TM) score, and predisposing, enabling, and need factors obtained from clinical assessments.Results: Only 5.2% of the cohort had outpatient geriatrician contact in Ontario, Canada. Derived Geriatric 5Ms (TM) score was associated with higher odds of contact, but the model had modest discriminatory power (c-statistic = 0.67). In the broader multivariable model, based on empirically included factors and adjusted for regional differences, age, worsening of decision-making, dementia, hallucinations, Parkinsonism, osteoporosis, and caregiver distress/institutionalization risk were associated with higher odds of geriatrician contact. Female sex, difficulties accessing home, impaired locomotion, recovery potential, hemiplegia/hemiparesis, and cancer, were associated with lower odds of contact. This model had good discriminatory power (c-statistic = 0.77).Conclusions: Few frail, community-dwelling older adults receiving HC had any outpatient geriatrician contact. While the derived Geriatric 5Ms (TM) score was associated with contact, a broader empirical model performed better than the Geriatric 5Ms (TM) in predicting contact with an outpatient geriatrician. Contact was mainly driven by conditions common in older adults, but evidence suggests that geriatricians are not evaluating the most medically complex and unstable older adults in the community. These findings suggest a need to re-examine the referral process for geriatricians and the allocation of limited specialized resources.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Data System. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) Study was funded by the Department of Health and Social Care in England to provide reliable and timely estimates of prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection over time, by person and place.
   Data Collection/Processing. The study team (researchers from Imperial College London and its logistics partner Ipsos) wrote to named individuals aged 5 years and older in random cross-sections of the population of England, using the National Health Service list of patients registered with a general practitioner (near-universal coverage) as a sampling frame. We collected data over 2 to 3 weeks approximately every month across 19 rounds of data collection from May 1, 2020, to March 31, 2022.
   Data Analysis/Dissemination. We have disseminated the data and study materials widely via the study Web site, preprints, publications in peer-reviewed journals, and the media. We make available data tabulations, suitably anonymized to protect participant confidentiality, on request to the study's data access committee.
   Public Health Implications. The study provided inter alia real-time data on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence over time, by area, and by sociodemographic variables; estimates of vaccine effectiveness; and symptom profiles, and detected emergence of new variants based on viral genome sequencing.

AB Globally, the number and proportion of people aged 60 years and older is growing fast. As people age, health needs become more complex, and the health system's responsiveness to older people's needs requires evidence-informed policies. Hence, this study explores the factors affecting the health policy development process for older people in Iran. We conducted 32 interviewers with people aged 60 years and older and 21 interviews with key informants involved in policy making related to older people. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Actors and stakeholders, policy structure, selected health policy processes, the health care service delivery system, government financial support, and community and culture building are the most influential factors in health policy making for older people. Government policies and health priority interventions are needed to address these influential factors for older people to ensure healthy aging over the life course.

AB A globally aging population results in the long-term care of people with chronic illnesses, affecting the living quality of the elderly. Integrating smart technology and long-term care services will enhance and maximize healthcare quality, while planning a smart long-term care information strategy could satisfy the variety of care demands regarding hospitals, home-care institutions, and communities. The evaluation of a smart long-term care information strategy is necessary to develop smart long-term care technology. This study applies a hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, which uses the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) integrated with the Analytic Network Process (ANP) for ranking and priority of a smart long-term care information strategy. In addition, this study considers the various resource constraints (budget, network platform cost, training time, labor cost-saving ratio, and information transmission efficiency) into the Zero-one Goal Programming (ZOGP) model to capture the optimal smart long-term care information strategy portfolios. The results of this study indicate that a hybrid MCDM decision model can provide decision-makers with the optimal service platform selection for a smart long-term care information strategy that can maximize information service benefits and allocate constrained resources most efficiently.

AB BackgroundAmong the core principles of the 2030 agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is the call to Leave no One behind (LNOB), a principle that gained resonance as the world contended with the COVID-19 pandemic. The south Indian state of Kerala received acclaim globally for its efforts in managing COVID-19 pandemic. Less attention has been paid, however, to how inclusive this management was, as well as if and how those "left behind" in testing, care, treatment, and vaccination efforts were identified and catered to. Filling this gap was the aim of our study.MethodsWe conducted In-depth interviews with 80 participants from four districts of Kerala from July to October 2021. Participants included elected local self-government members, medical and public health staff, as well as community leaders. Following written informed consent procedures, each interviewee was asked questions about whom they considered the most "vulnerable" in their areas. They were also asked if there were any special programmes/schemes to support the access of "vulnerable" groups to general and COVID related health services, as well as other needs. Recordings were transliterated into English and analysed thematically by a team of researchers using ATLAS.ti 9.1 software.ResultsThe age range of participants was between 35 and 60 years. Vulnerability was described differentially by geography and economic context; for e.g., fisherfolk were identified in coastal areas while migrant labourers were considered as vulnerable in semi-urban areas. In the context of COVID-19, some participants reflected that everyone was vulnerable. In most cases, vulnerable groups were already beneficiaries of various government schemes within and beyond the health sector. During COVID, the government prioritized access to COVID-19 testing and vaccination among marginalized population groups like palliative care patients, the elderly, migrant labourers, as well as Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes communities. Livelihood support like food kits, community kitchen, and patient transportation were provided by the LSGs to support these groups. This involved coordination between health and other departments, which may be formalised, streamlined and optimised in the future.ConclusionHealth system actors and local self-government members were aware of vulnerable populations prioritized under various schemes but did not describe vulnerable groups beyond this. Emphasis was placed on the broad range of services made available to these "left behind" groups through interdepartmental and multi-stakeholder collaboration. Further study (currently underway) may offer insights into how these communities - identified as vulnerable - perceive themselves, and whether/how they receive, and experience schemes designed for them. At the program level, inclusive and innovative identification and recruitment mechanisms need to be devised to identify populations who are currently left behind but may still be invisible to system actors and leaders.

AB The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic has been a governance challenge for countries and cities worldwide. In China, the community-based joint prevention and control governance mechanism is one of the highlights of the "Chinese experience" in fighting the pandemic. As aging accelerates, communities can take on more functions in managing the health of their residents. Especially in the post-pandemic era, the actual needs of community residents in terms of health, medical care, and elderly care need to be addressed. This paper uses a questionnaire to understand the current situation of community health management in Beijing, followed by the selection of four typical communities for in-depth interviews, and uses the triple process of open coding, selective coding, and theoretical coding of the grounded theory to analyze residents' needs and willingness for proactive health management. More than 80 concepts, 41 categories, and 6 master categories were obtained from 204 initial statements. The "logical line" of the relationship between the main categories was constructed, and we developed a conceptual model of community-based proactive health management, consisting of six dimensions: (1) perception and willingness, (2) primary population, (3) health behavior paradigm, (4) management mechanism, (5) information technology applications, and (6) facilities and services. The study aims to contribute to the community-based health management in China and for the international community and provide strategies to improve community-based health management.

AB BackgroundHealthcare and welfare systems worldwide are unprepared to accommodate the growing population of older people. Simultaneously, the cost of reactive care for older people is increasing. However, healthcare systems in many countries are reforming towards integrated and person-centred care with a focus on health promotion and proactive actions. The Integrating Health Promotion with and for Older People - eHealth (IHOPe) project aims to describe and evaluate a person-centred e-support intervention that promotes a sustainable partnership between community-dwelling frail older people and health and social care professionals.MethodsThe IHOPe project is designed as a randomised controlled trial comparing a control group receiving standard care with an intervention group receiving standard care and add-on person-centred care through telephone support and a digital platform. The primary outcome measure is a composite score of changes in general self-efficacy and the need for unscheduled hospital care. The project is conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden. At least 220 participants aged >= 75 years will be included after being screened using a frailty instrument. The study design, intervention components, digital platform, and questionnaires were developed in close collaboration with an advisory group of inter-professional researchers, stakeholders, clinicians, and older representatives. Data will mainly be collected through questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after inclusion in the study. Recruitment is ongoing and should be completed during 2023. Data will be analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods. The evaluation will include effectiveness, process, and health economics. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg, Sweden (Dnr 2019-05364, Dnr 2020-03550, Dnr 2021-03255).DiscussionThe findings will expand our knowledge of remotely integrated person-centred care for frail older people. Thereby, the IHOPe project is expected to fill highlighted knowledge gaps on intervention evaluations including the triad of person-centred, digital, and integrated care elements, as well as economic evaluations of remote health services for frail older people. The study is ongoing, and the results are not completed but if they turn out to be positive, implementation is not limited to time or location.

AB PurposeTelemedicine are experiencing an unprecedented boom globally since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the most vulnerable groups amid COVID-19, the digital delivery of healthcare poses great challenges to the elderly population, caregiver, health service providers, and health policy makers. To bridge the service delivery gaps between the telemedicine demand side and supply side, explore evidence-based approach for integrated care, address challenges for aging policy, and build foundation for the development of data-driven and community-based telemedicine, our R&D team applied translational research to design and develop telemedicine "SMART" for enhancing elderly mental health wellbeing amid COVID-19. Our aim is to investigate the preparedness mechanisms of mental health disease including response, intervention, and connection these three healthcare delivery pipelines with the collection, consolidation, and synergy of heath parameters and social determinants, using data analytics approach to achieve Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM).MethodsA mix of quantitative and qualitative research design for scientifically rigorous consultation and analysis was conducted from Jan 2020 to June 2021 in Hong Kong. An exploratory and descriptive qualitative design was used in this study. The data were collected through focus group discussions conducted from elderly and their caregivers living in 10 main districts of Hong Kong. Our research pilot tested "SMART" targeting for elderly with mental health improvement needs. Baseline questionnaire with 110 tele-medicine product users includes questions on demographic information, self-rated mental health digital adoption. The follow-up five focus group discussions with 57 users (elderly and their caregivers) further explore the social determinants of telemedicine transformation and help propose the integrated telemedicine paradigm shift framework establishment, development, and enhancement.ResultsGrounded on the baseline needs assessment and feedbacks collected, it is evident that multi-dimensional health information from the four various streams (community, clinic, home, remote) and customized digital health solutions are playing a key role in addressing elderly mental health digital service needs and bridging digital divide. The designed tele-medicine product lines up health service provider (supplier side) and elderly specific needs (demand side) with our three-level design, enables elderly and their families to follow and control their own health management and connect with the service provider, community of practice (CoP), and health policy makers.ConclusionIt's beneficial to involve elderly and gerontechnology stakeholders as part of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) before and throughout the developing and delivery phases an integrated and age-friendly digital intervention. The challenges in applying and disseminating telemedicine reflected by the elderly and caregivers can be used as important input for further development and indicators for the sustainable and integrated elderly primary care framework.

AB BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has greatly challenged all public social services, particularly home-based community care services (HBCCS). Aberdeen Kai-fong Association (AKA) is a non-government organization (NGO) in Hong Kong that systematically manages the challenges to HBCCS. This paper presents a practical example of the implementation and evaluation of the risk management process for HBCCS. MethodsMixed-method design was used to evaluate the implementation of the risk management process in encountering the challenges from existing and potential problems to maintain and enhance HBCCS in four major areas amidst the pandemic. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey and three qualitative focus group interviews were conducted by AKA from 30 December 2021 to 12 March 2022 to collect staff feedback on the institutional risk management process in four areas. Results109 HBCCS staff members (69% aged 40 years or above; 80% female) completed the questionnaire survey. For resource arrangement and staff training, over 90% of the participants agreed (including strongly agreed) that they had sufficient and reliable personal protective equipment and clear infection control guideline and effective training. Over 80% agreed they had safe working space and effective manpower allocation. However, only 75% agreed they had received emotional support from the organization. Over 90% agreed that the basic services were maintained for service continuation and enhancement, the service users and their families trusted the organization, and the provided services were adjusted according to users' needs. 88% agreed that the organization had obtained support from the neighborhood. For communication among stakeholders, over 80% agreed they had open discussions with the senior management team, and the senior management team was willing to listen. Twenty-six staff members joined the three focus group interviews. The qualitative findings corroborated the quantitative results. Staff appreciated the organisation's work to enhance staff safety and continue advancing services during this difficult period. Regular in-service training, updated information and guidelines to staff, and proactive phone calls to service users, especially the elderly, were suggested to enhance the quality of services. ConclusionsThe paper could help NGOs and others encountering management challenges in community social services in diverse settings amidst the pandemic and beyond.

AB As the degree of elders' social activity and self-care ability depreciates, the potential risk for elderly people who live independently increases. The development of assistive services such as smart homes could likely provide them with a safer living environment. These systems collect sensor data to monitor residents' daily activities and provide assistance services accordingly. In order to do so, a smart home must understand its residents' daily activities and identify their periodic behavioral daily routine accordingly. However, existing solutions mainly focus on the temporal feature of daily activities and require prior labeling of where sensors are geographically deployed. In this study, we extract implicit spatial information from hidden correlations between sensors deployed in the environment and present a concept of virtual locations that establishes an abstract spatial representation of the physical living space so that prior labeling of the actual location of the sensors is not required. To demonstrate the viability of this concept, an unsupervised periodic behavioral routine discovery method that does not require any predefined location-specific sensor data for a smart home environment is proposed. The experimental results show that with the help of virtual location, the proposed method achieves high accuracy in activity discovery and significantly reduces the computation time required to complete the task relative to a system without virtual location. Furthermore, the result of simulated anomaly detection also shows that the periodic behavioral routine discovery system is more tolerant to differences in the way routines are performed.

AB Background: Older adults frequently attend the emergency department (ED) and experience high rates of subsequent adverse outcomes including functional decline, ED re-presentation and unplanned hospital admission. The development of effective interventions to prevent such outcomes is a key priority for research and service provision. Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility of a physiotherapy-led integrated care intervention for older adults discharged from the ED (ED PLUS).Patients and Methods: Older adults presenting to the ED of a university teaching hospital with undifferentiated medical complaints and discharged within 72 hours were computer randomised in a ratio of 1:1:1 to deliver usual care, Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) in the ED, or ED PLUS. ED PLUS is an evidence-based and stakeholder-informed intervention to bridge the care transition between the ED and community by initiating a CGA in the ED and implementing a six-week, multi-component, self-management programme in the patient's home. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. All clinical and process outcomes were assessed by a research nurse blinded to group allocation. Data analyses were primarily descriptive.Results: Twenty-nine participants were recruited indicating a 67% recruitment rate. At 6 months, there was 100% retention in the usual care group, 88% in the CGA group and 90% in the ED PLUS group. ED PLUS participants expressed positive feedback, and there was a trend towards improved function and quality of life and less ED revisits and unscheduled hospitalisations in the ED PLUS group. Conclusion: ED PLUS bridges the transition of care between the index visit to the ED and the community and is feasible using systematic recruitment strategies. Despite recruitment challenges in the context of COVID-19, the intervention was successfully delivered and well received by participants. There was a lower incidence of functional decline and improved quality of life in the ED PLUS group.Trial Registration: The trial was registered in Clinical Trials Protocols and Results System as of 21st July 2021, with registration number NCT04983602.

AB OBJECTIVE: To understand the perception of different actors involved in the older adults care process in the intersectoral strategy of the Programa Maior Cuidado (PMC - Greater Care Program), aiming at the development of actions that contribute to the improvement of the services provided.
   METHODS: Eleven qualitative interviews guided by a semi-structured script were conducted in 2020 with key informants directly involved in the PMC: the older adults and their families, caregivers, health professionals and social assistance. In addition, to understand the functioning and proposals of the PMC, a documentary analysis was also carried out with the tracking of existing information on the guidelines, protocols, and management instruments. The content analysis technique was used to classify textual data, and the interpretation process was mediated by the theoretical-methodological framework of hermeneutic anthropology.
   RESULTS: Two categories were identified: "Repercussions of the care offered by the PMC: the 'little' that makes a difference" and "Problems beyond the PMC: the limits of family care in the face of violence against the older adults". For all interviewees, the perception the PMC is very necessary is unison, being able to minimize the occurrence of health problems and avoid transfers of the older adults to hospitals and Long Stay Institutions for the Elderly (Instituicao de Longa Permanencia - ILPI in Portuguese). Chronic comorbidities increase the demands of health care and generate situations that can be managed by the PMC caregiver. Population aging requires the planning of strategies and public policies aimed at providing continuous care for the older adults, including those living in communities. The PMC emerges as an intersectoral alternative to assist in this issue.
   CONCLUSIONS: The PMC can be considered a good practice model to be expanded to other locations, however there are gaps that need to be rediscussed so that its processes are improved and its results enhanced.

AB Background: Investigating adherence to the Atrial Fibrillation Better Care (ABC) pathway management and identifying gaps between the real world and established guidelines can lead to better integrated management of AF. Current data on adherence to ABC pathway management among community elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in Chinese communities is limited. Aim: To investigate the adherence to ABC pathway management among community elderly patients with AF in China. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected from the 2020 National Basic Public Health Service Program database that includes health examination information for all residents >65 years of age in Yuexiu, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. Demographic and clinical characteristics data from 197 community AF patients were obtained. Results: Among the 197 AF patients, 103 (52.3%) were male, 117 (59.4%) were & GE;75 years of age, 127 (64.5%) had a senior middle school education or above, 84.3% were married, and 195 (99.0%) had medical insurance. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (72.1%, 142/197), dyslipidaemia (28.4%, 56/197), CAD (28.9%, 57/197), and diabetes (24.9%, 49/197). In terms of the ABC management pathway, 21.8% (43/197), 82.7% (163/197), and 31.5% (62/197) of AF patients were classified into the A-adherent group, B-adherent group, and C-adherent group, respectively. The level of adherence to ABC pathway management was very low (9.1%, 18/197) and independently associated with age and multimorbidity. Conclusion: The level of adherence to ABC pathway management in community elderly patients with AF was unsatisfactory. Further research is warranted to improve the integrated management of AF.

AB Background: As people age, the risk of becoming frail increases, often leading to negative outcomes and less well-being. Within the light of prevention, early detection and guidance to the right care and support is crucial. This study aimed to give an overview of the descriptive results of the D-SCOPE program and evaluate the process. Methods: The D-SCOPE program was developed as a detection and prevention program for frail community-dwelling older adults. The program creates a continuum of care and support, consisting of 6 steps: (1) Targeted case-finding using risk profiles for purposeful selection, (2) Preventive home-visit by an older volunteer, (3) Home visits by a professional, (4), Warm referral, (5) Monthly follow-up and (6) Long-term follow-up by home visit. The effectiveness of this program, in terms of satisfaction and meaningfulness, was studied quantitatively by means of a randomized controlled trial amongst 869 people with a frailty risk profile and qualitatively by 15 focus groups interviews. Results: The quantitative study revealed that 83.9% of the participants found the different home visits within the D-SCOPE program useful. The focus group interviews shed light on several issues and advantages: a more efficient case finding due to the applied risk factors for frailty, a more intensive tailor-made care and support due to the warm referral, the importance of both small-scaled and larger interventions based on the wishes irrespective of the state of frailty of the older persons, the focus on a strengths-based instead of a deficit-based approach and the follow up as being one of the greatest strengths of the project. However, to fully understand the benefits of the program a shift in mind from intervention to prevention is necessary. Conclusions: Our quantitative data show that most participants found the home visits meaningful and were satisfied with the intervention. The qualitative findings provided more insights into the experiences of the participants with the process. Based on these insights of the 6-step model of preventive home visits, municipalities and organizations can apply this model to carry out more targeted home visits.

AB PurposeWith technological progress, the integration of aged care with technology is a new challenge. This study developed a theoretical model of smart aged care in the community to meet the diverse needs of community-dwelling older adults. MethodsThis qualitative study recruited 22 participants from three communities in Chongqing, China. Through semi-structured interviews and grounded theory, this study analyzed the needs of community-dwelling older adults for smart aged care and identified strategies. ResultsNine categories were identified, including five need categories, three important factors, and one outcome objective. Furthermore, four health provider topics were proposed. ConclusionsAlthough the application of information technology has enhanced convenience and possibilities, its popularity and satisfaction are low. Information technology can be successfully introduced into the lives of community-dwelling older adults only by truly understanding their needs. Implications of nursing practiceSmart aged care in the community has positive effects on nursing outcomes for older adults. This study's findings can help caregivers understand the various dimensions of the needs of community-dwelling older adults and relevant influencing factors under smart aged care to increase its popularity and satisfaction. Furthermore, this can promote the integration of intelligent technology and manual services in nursing practice.

AB Background: Little is known about frailty in the ambulance setting, or its association with outcomes relevant to ambulance services. We sought to measure frailty in people aged >= 50 attended by an ambulance, and describe the relationship between frailty, odds of conveyance to hospital, and duration at scene. Methods: An observational study between 01/01/2021-30/06/2021 in North East Ambulance Service, England. Participants were aged >= 50 attended by an ambulance, excluding patients requiring immediate treatment for a life-threatening condition or with Glasgow Coma Scale < 15. Paramedics (n = 112) measured patient frailty using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Additional information was extracted from ambulance care records. Weighted regression models examined associations between frailty, hospital conveyance, and duration at scene. Results: Three thousand and fifty-six callouts were observed (mean patient age: 78.1 years, 57.2% female). Frailty prevalence (CFS >= 5) was 58.7%. Median duration at scene was 47.0 min (interquartile range 34.0-67.0 min). Ambulances spent a median of 8.2 (95%CI:5.4-11.0) minutes longer with frail patients than non-frail patients. Frail patients were less likely to be conveyed to hospital than non-frail patients (OR:0.75, 95%CI:0.60-0.94). Conclusion: Frailty is common among people aged >= 50 attended by an ambulance and an important influence on workload. Ambulance services need a good understanding of frailty to meet patient needs. As populations age, community support should be prioritised to deliver appropriate frailty care and reduce demands on ambulance services.

AB Background The aging of the population has made the health problems of the elderly increasingly prominent, and their health needs are increasing. Existing studies on health resource integration approaches are mostly incomplete in assessing the health service capacity from the perspective of the health service provider. Objective The unmet health needs of the elderly were sampled and analyzed from the perspective of health service demanders. To explore how to build an integrated medical organization structure to better meet the health needs of the elderly. Methods A whole-group sampling method was used to conduct a questionnaire survey of 1527 older adults in N district of H city, Zhejiang province, China, to cross-sectionally analyze their current status of unmet health needs. Results The survey and analysis found that the needs of the elderly in this community to obtain disease-related knowledge, rational exercise, a healthy diet, and access to health information were not met. There were more patients with chronic diseases, and the top three chronic disease prevalence rates were hypertension (40.2%), dyslipidemia (8.4), and diabetes (7%). Chronic disease co-morbidities accounted for 13.3%. Conclusion The relatively independently set up health service system at the present stage in China can no longer fully meet the health needs of the elderly, and the health service providers should provide integrated and continuous health services to meet the needs of whole-cycle health management. Therefore, we believe that effectively integrating various health service providers in the region and building an integrated health service organization with general practitioners as the core may be a solution to the current situation of unmet health needs of the elderly.

AB Background Digitalization has been recognized as an efficient and cost-effective solution to address the increasing need for care due to the ageing population and the rise in people with dementia. This has subsequently increased the need to also care for family caregivers in community settings. Another benefit of digitalization is the introduction of new service concepts within service-dominant logic namely, value co-creation, which is changing the dynamics in healthcare, transitioning from a provider-centric to a customer-centric approach. The literature indicates that this transition is a slow process in healthcare due to the complex service context consisting of multi-stakeholders, with a fragmented decision-making process. This has resulted in limited research on how individuals co-create value through technology. The study aimed to explore how family caregivers to people with dementia living at home, as consumers of healthcare services co-create value in a multi-stakeholder context through a tailormade mHealth application. Methods A qualitative explorative design was used. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 12 family caregivers of people with dementia living at home. The data were analyzed deductively using qualitative content analysis. Results The findings show how family caregivers to people with dementia as healthcare consumers, engaged with a mHealth application and other actors in their service network through different levels of value co-creation activities. Conclusion This paper showed a willingness among family caregivers to people with dementia living at home, who mostly consisted of older people, to implement new technology to assist them with their caregiving tasks. The different value co-creation activities adopted by the family caregivers generated different levels of experiential value such as support, knowledge, and increased access to healthcare.

AB The demographic transition towards an ageing population and the epidemiological transition from communicable to noncommunicable diseases have increased the demand for rehabilitation services globally. The aims of this paper were to describe the integration of rehabilitation into the Japanese health system and to illustrate how health information systems containing real-world data can be used to improve rehabilitation services, especially for the ageing population of Japan. In addition, there is an overview of how evidence-informed rehabilitation policy is guided by the analysis of large Japanese health databases, such as: (i) the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups; (ii) the long-term care insurance comprehensive database; and (iii) the Long-Term Care Information System for Evidence database. Especially since the 1990s, the integration of rehabilitation into the Japanese health system has been driven by the country's ageing population and rehabilitation is today provided widely to an increasing number of older adults. General medical insurance in Japan covers acute and post-acute (or recovery) intensive rehabilitation. Long-term care insurance covers rehabilitation at long-term care institutions and community facilities for older adults with the goal of helping to maintain independence in an ageing population. The analysis of large health databases can be used to improve the management of rehabilitation care services and increase scientific knowledge as well as guide rehabilitation policy and practice. In particular, such analyses could help solve the current challenges of overtreatment and undertreatment by identifying strict criteria for determining who should receive long-term rehabilitation services.

AB Quality of life is a critically important outcome measure in aged care. However, few studies have provided a detailed examination of what quality of life means to older adults living in residential care. In the current study, N = 43 older adults (67 to 99 years) living in six residential aged care facilities in four Australian states took part in semi-structured interviews. Participants had normal cognition through to mild /moderate cognitive impairment as measured by the PAS-Cog, were able to provide informed consent, and could participate in an interview conducted in English. Interviews were transcribed, and data was analyzed in NVivo using thematic analysis. Both physical and psycho-social aspects were identified as important for older adults' quality of life with six key quality of life domains identified: independence, mobility, pain management, social connections, emotional well-being, and activities. More research is needed to test these domains with a more diverse sample of older adults living in residential aged care, in particular older adults from culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Such qualitative work is essential for the development of suitable quality of life measures for this population and provides valuable information to inform improvements to care practices and service provision. Some ways in which the identified quality of life domains could be used to enhance care provision are discussed.

AB BackgroundType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an independent risk factor for functional limitations among the older population. The predicted increase in T2DM cases combined with the ongoing rapidly aging population may further burden the already overloaded healthcare system and aggravate the loss of economic self-sufficiency. This study aimed to investigate the activities of daily living (ADL) and its influencing factors on older people with T2DM, and to provide implications for the development and improvement of community nursing services in the context rapidly aging population in China. MethodsFrom March 2019 to June 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey among older T2DM patients in Fuzhou, using a multi-stage cluster sampling approach. Functional status was measured by the Lawton ADL scale. Stata "nptrend" test was used to examine the trend of ordinal variables on ADL. Non-conditional logistic regression was used to identify factors affecting ADL limitations. ResultsA total of 2016 questionnaires were received, with a response rate of 96%. 12.4% of participants suffered from varying degrees of functional impairment. ADL limitations increased with age. More comorbidities were associated with a greater risk of developing functional limitations in ADLs. the following sub-groups were more likely to suffer from ADL impairment: those aged 70 and over years (OR = 1.99, 95%CI 1.77-2.56), living in an aged care house or with spouse/children (OR = 2.31, 95%CI 1.25-4.26), low monthly income (OR = 1.49, 95%CI 1.28-1.64), without health insurance (OR = 1.82, 95%CI 1.40-2.40), tight family expenses (OR = 1.95, 95%CI 1.42-2.69), having stroke (OR = 6.70, 95%CI 2.22-20.23) or malignant tumor (OR = 4.45, 95%CI 1.27-15.53), irregular eating habit (OR = 2.55, 95%CI 2.23-2.92), smoking (OR = 1.40, 95%CI 1.22-1.60), sedentary lifestyle (OR = 2.04, 95%CI 1.46-2.85), lack of physical exercise (OR = 1.35, 95%CI 1.19-1.53), sleeping difficulty (OR = 1.25, 95%CI 1.10-1.42), and lack of family support (OR = 1.19, 95%CI 1.10-1.29). ConclusionOlder adults (>= 70 years) with T2DM had a high prevalence of functional limitations across a range of daily living tasks, which not only affect individual life of quality but also present a huge burden on the family, health services system, and the whole society. Identified factors associated with ADL limitations may provide useful information for targeted nursing practice and health promotion.

AB BackgroundOpioid use disorder (OUD) among older adults (age >= 65) is a growing yet underexplored public health concern and previous research has mainly assumed that the spatial process underlying geographic patterns of population health outcomes is constant across space. This study is among the first to apply a local modeling perspective to examine the geographic disparity in county-level OUD rates among older Medicare beneficiaries and the spatial non-stationarity in the relationships between determinants and OUD rates. MethodsData are from a variety of national sources including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services beneficiary-level data from 2020 aggregated to the county-level and county-equivalents, and the 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for 3,108 contiguous US counties. We use multiscale geographically weighted regression to investigate three dimensions of spatial process, namely "level of influence" (the percentage of older Medicare beneficiaries affected by a certain determinant), "scalability" (the spatial process of a determinant as global, regional, or local), and "specificity" (the determinant that has the strongest association with the OUD rate). ResultsThe results indicate great spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of OUD rates. Beneficiaries' characteristics, including the average age, racial/ethnic composition, and the average hierarchical condition categories (HCC) score, play important roles in shaping OUD rates as they are identified as primary influencers (impacting more than 50% of the population) and the most dominant determinants in US counties. Moreover, the percentage of non-Hispanic white beneficiaries, average number of mental health conditions, and the average HCC score demonstrate spatial non-stationarity in their associations with the OUD rates, suggesting that these variables are more important in some counties than others. ConclusionsOur findings highlight the importance of a local perspective in addressing the geographic disparity in OUD rates among older adults. Interventions that aim to reduce OUD rates in US counties may adopt a place-based approach, which could consider the local needs and differential scales of spatial process.

ID ADVERSE OUTCOMES; IMPLEMENTATION; PROGRAM
AB Objective To describe a feasibility pilot study for older adults that addresses the digital divide, unmet health care needs, and the 4Ms of Age-Friendly Health Systems via the emergency department (ED) follow-up home visits supported by telehealth. Data Sources and Study Setting Data sources were a pre-implementation site survey and pilot phase individual-level patient data from six US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) EDs. Study Design A pre-implementation survey assessed existing geriatric ED processes. In the pilot called SCOUTS (Supporting Community Outpatient, Urgent care & Telehealth Services), sites identified high-risk patients during an ED visit. After ED discharge, Intermediate Care Technicians (ICTs, former military medics), performed follow-up telephone, or home visits. During the follow-up visit, ICTs identified "what matters," performed geriatric screens aligned with Age-Friendly Health Systems, observed home safety risks, assisted with video telehealth check-ins with ED providers, and provided care coordination. SCOUTS visit data were recorded in the patient's electronic medical record using a standardized template. Data Collection/Extraction Methods Sites were surveyed via electronic form. Administrative pilot data extracted from VA Corporate Data Warehouse, May-October 2021. Principle Findings Site surveys showed none of the EDs had a formalized way of identifying the 4 M "what matters." During the pilot, ICT performed 56 telephone and 247 home visits. All home visits included a telehealth visit with an ED provider (n = 244) or geriatrician (n = 3). ICTs identified 44 modifiable home fall risks and 99 unmet care needs, recommended 80 pieces of medical equipment, placed 36 specialty care consults, and connected 180 patients to a Patient Aligned Care Team member for follow-up. Conclusions A post-ED follow-up program in which former military medics perform geriatric screens and care coordination is feasible. Combining telehealth and home visits allows providers to address what matters and unmet care needs.

AB Background: Web-based personal health records (PHRs) have the potential to improve the quality, accuracy, and timeliness of health care. However, the international uptake of web-based PHRs has been slow. Populations experiencing disadvantages are less likely to use web-based PHRs, potentially widening health inequities within and among countries.
   Objective: With limited understanding of the predictors of community uptake and use of web-based PHR, the aim of this study was to identify the predictors of awareness, engagement, and use of the Australian national web-based PHR, My Health Record (MyHR).
   Methods: A population-based survey of adult participants residing in regional Victoria, Australia, was conducted in 2018 using telephone interviews. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, was used to assess the relationship among digital health literacy, health literacy, and demographic characteristics, and the 3 dependent variables of MyHR: awareness, engagement, and use. Digital health literacy and health literacy were measured using multidimensional tools, using all 7 scales of the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire and 4 out of the 9 scales of the Health Literacy Questionnaire.
   Results: A total of 998 responses were analyzed. Many elements of digital health literacy were strongly associated with MyHR awareness, engagement, and use. A 1-unit increase in each of the 7 eHealth Literacy Questionnaire scales was associated with a 2-to 4-fold increase in the odds of using MyHR: using technology to process health information (odds ratio [OR] 4.14, 95% CI 2.34-7.31), understanding of health concepts and language (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.08-4.69), ability to actively engage with digital services (OR 4.44, 95% CI 2.55-7.75), feel safe and in control (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.43-3.88), motivated to engage with digital services (OR 4.24, 95% CI 2.36-7.61), access to digital services that work (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.32-4.69), and digital services that suit individual needs (OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.97-6.15). The Health Literacy Questionnaire scales of health care support, actively managing health, and social support were also associated with a 1-to 2-fold increase in the odds of using MyHR. Using the internet to search for health information was another strong predictor; however, older people and those with less education were less likely to use MyHR.
   Conclusions: This study revealed strong and consistent patterns of association between digital health literacy and the use of a web-based PHR. The results indicate potential actions for promoting PHR uptake, including improving digital technology and skill experiences that may improve digital health literacy and willingness to engage in web-based PHR. Uptake may also be improved through more responsive digital services, strengthened health care, and better social support. A holistic approach, including targeted solutions, is needed to ensure that web-based PHR can realize its full potential to help reduce health inequities.

AB Objectives The present study aimed to determine the bidirectional relationship between cognitive function and the loss hierarchy of activities of daily living (ADL) among older adults in China. Design Data were derived from the Longitudinal Study on Family Caregivers for Frail Older Adults Aged 75 or Above in Shanghai (2010-2013). Setting Community-dwelling older adults and their primary caregivers were invited to participate in this research. Participants The inclusion criteria for the older adults were as follows: (a) have a Shanghai urban household registration status, (b) be 75 years old or older, (c) have no fewer than two limitations in ADLs or equivalent, and (d) have one primary caregiver aged 18 years or older. 469 older adults cared by their spouses or children were included in the final analytical sample of this research. Primary and secondary outcome measures Cognitive function was assessed using the Chinese version of the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire and ADLs were measured by self-reports of having difficulty or needing help with basic daily activities. Results Cognitive function in 2010 was a significant predictor of intermediate loss of ADLs in 2013 (beta=-0.13, p<0.05) and late loss of ADLs in 2013 (beta=-0.17, p<0.01). The loss hierarchy of ADLs among older adults was not shown to be significant as a risk factor of cognitive function in 2013. Conclusions Practitioners are encouraged to adopt the ADL loss hierarchy as a supplementary needs assessment tool to make the social service delivery process more effective, economical and tailored. Cognitive function change monitoring programmes and services providing education on nutrition and encouraging social participation of older individuals were also helpful in promoting the quality of life of the older adults.

AB COVID-19 has had a disproportionate and devastating impact on older adults. As health care resources suddenly shifted to emergency response planning, many health and community support services were cancelled, postponed, or shifted to virtual care. This rapid transformation of geriatric care resulted in an immediate need for practical guidance on decision making, planning and delivery of virtual care for older adults and caregivers. This article outlines the rapid co-design process that supported the development of a guidance document intended to support health and community support services providers. Data were collected through consultation sessions, surveys, and a rapid literature review, and analyzed using appropriate qualitative and quantitative methods. Although this work took place within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting resources and lessons learned related to collective impact, co-design, population-based planning, and digital technologies can be applied more broadly.

AB Background When a Zuni elder sustains a fall-related injury, the closest tribal skilled nursing facility is 100 miles from the Pueblo and no physical therapy services are available. Thus, fall prevention strategies as a primary intervention to avert injurious falls and preserve aging in place are needed. The objective of the study is to compare the effectiveness of a community health representative (CHR)-delivered, culturally-adapted Otago Exercise Program (OEP) fall prevention program compared to the standard of care education-based fall risk management. Methods "Standing Strong in Tribal Communities: Assessing Elder Falls Disparity" is mixed-methods research with a randomized controlled trial. The CHRs will be trained to deliver the culturally-adapted OEP trial and offer advantages of speaking "Shiwi" (Zuni tribal language) and understanding Zuni traditions, family structures, and elders' preferences for receiving health information. Focus groups will be conducted to assure all materials are culturally appropriate, and adapted. A physical therapist will train CHRs to screen elders for falls risk and to deliver the OEP to the intervention group and education to the control group. Up to 400 Zuni elders will be screened by the CHRs for falls risk and 200 elders will be enrolled into the study (1:1 random allocation by household). The intervention is 6 months with measurements at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is improved strength and balance (timed up and go, sit to stand and 4 stage balance test), secondary outcomes include falls incidence, self-efficacy using Attitudes to Falls-Related Interventions Scale, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12 (SF-12v2) and Self-Efficacy for Managing Daily Activities. Discussion Fall prevention for Zuni elders was identified as a tribal priority and this trial is built upon longstanding collaborations between the investigative team, Zuni tribal leaders, and multiple tribal health programs. Delivery by the CHRs make this model more acceptable, and thus, more sustainable long term. This study has the potential to change best practice for elder care in tribal and rural areas with limited access to physical therapist-delivered fall prevention interventions and aligns with tribal goals to avert fall-related injury, reduce healthcare disparity, and preserve elder's independence.

AB Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing challenges within the Canadian healthcare system and reinforced the need for long-term care (LTC) reform to prioritise building an integrated continuum of services to meet the needs of older adults. Almost all Canadians want to live, age and receive care at home, yet funding for home and community-based care and support services is limited and integration with primary care and specialised geriatric services is sparse. Optimisation of existing home and community care services would equip the healthcare system to proactively meet the needs of older Canadians and enhance capacity within the hospital and residential care sectors to facilitate access and reduce wait times for those whose needs are best served in these settings. The aim of this study is to design a model of long-term 'life care' at home (LTlifeC model) to sustainably meet the needs of a greater number of community-dwelling older adults. Methods and analysis An explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be applied across three phases. In the quantitative phase, secondary data analysis will be applied to historical Ontario Home Care data to develop unique groupings of patient needs according to known predictors of residential LTC home admission, and to define unique patient vignettes using dominant care needs. In the qualitative phase, a modified eDelphi process and focus groups will engage community-based clinicians, older adults and family caregivers in the development of needs-based home care packages. The third phase involves triangulation to determine initial model feasibility. Ethics and dissemination This study has received ethics clearance from the University of Waterloo Research Ethics Board (ORE #42182). Results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and local, national and international conferences. Other forms of knowledge mobilisation will include webinars, policy briefs and lay summaries to elicit support for implementation and pilot testing phases.

AB Background Reablement is a multi-professional and internationally established home-based health care service for mainly older people with the aim to reduce the need for long-term care and to promote self-determination. However, it is unknown which factors would facilitate the implementation of reablement in health care services. Therefore, the aim of this work was to identify relevant factors for the implementation process and to elucidate their importance based on the perspectives of experts. Methods Within an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design, a literature search followed by framework analysis was carried out using the five domains of the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research (CFIR) to collect potentially relevant factors for implementation of reablement. A survey was then drawn up encompassing the factors identified. Within the survey international reablement - experts were asked to rate the relevance of these factors . Results The literature search identified 58 publications that served as sources for the framework analysis, where 40 potentially relevant factors were clustered into the five CFIR domains. These 40 factors were rated by experts in an online-survey. Based on the analysis of survey-data, 35 factors were considered as relevant for implementation of reablement services. The CFIR-domain characteristics of individuals, including teamwork and communication skills, was seen as most relevant. Conclusions The implementation of reablement services is complex and requires the consideration of numerous factors, especially regarding the CFIR-domain characteristics of individuals. From the perspective of the survey ' s participants one important factor of a successful implementation was the engagement of the persons involved. It requires team members with a strong, shared vision. Communication skills are highly important to promote teamwork and intensive training is needed to establish these skills. Further research on the implementation of reablement services is essential to realize its full potential.

TI The prospects of artificial intelligence in urban planning
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Urban planning; technology; artificial intelligence; data science
ID SMART CITIES; AUTOMATA; MODELS
AB Over the past several decades, urban planning has considered a variety of advanced analysis methods with greater and lesser degrees of adoption. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is probably the most notable, with others such as database management systems (DBMS), decision support systems (DSS), planning support systems (PSS), and expert systems (ES), having mixed levels of recognition and acceptance (Kontokosta, C. E. (2021). Urban informatics in the science and practice of planning. Journal of Planning Education and Research, 41(4), 382-395. doi:10.1177/0739456X18793716; Yigitcanlar, T., Desouza, K. C., Butler, L., & Roozkhosh, F. (2020). Contributions and risks of artificial intelligence (AI) in building smarter cities: Insights from a systematic review of the literature. Energies, 13(6), 1473). Advances in information technologies have moved very slowly in the field of urban planning, more recently concerning 'smart city' technologies while revolutionizing other domains, such as consumer goods and services. Baidu, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and many others are using these technologies to gain insights into consumer behaviour and characteristics and improve supply chains and logistics.
   This is an opportune time for urban planners to consider the application of AI-related techniques given vast increases in data availability, increased processing speeds, and increased popularity and development of planning related applications. Research on these topics by urban planning scholars has increased over the past few years, but there is little evidence to suggest that the results are making it into the hands of professional planners (Batty, M. (2018). Artificial intelligence and smart cities. Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 45(1), 3-6; Batty, M. (2021). Planning education in the digital age. Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 48(2), 207-211). Others encourage planners to leverage the ubiquity of data and advances in computing to enhance redistributive justice in information resources and procedural justice in decision-making among marginalized communities (Boeing, G., Besbris, M., Schachter, A., & Kuk, J. (2020). Housing search in the Age of Big data: Smarter cities or the same Old blind spots? Housing Policy Debate, 31(1), 112-126; Goodspeed, R. (2015). Smart cities: Moving beyond urban cybernetics to tackle wicked problems. Cambridge journal of regions, Economy and Society, 8(1), 79-92). This article highlights findings from a recent literature review on AI in planning and discusses the results of a national survey of urban planners about their perspectives on AI adoption and concerns they have expressed about its broader use in the profession. Currently, the outlook is mixed, matching how urban planners initially viewed the early stages of computer adoption within the profession. And yet today, personal computers are essential to any job.

AB Background: Older people with multimorbidity are usually required to manage multiple medications and complex medication regimens. However, clinical guidelines for medication management almost entirely focus on a single disease. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of medication self-management interventions for older people with multimorbidity.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-led medication self-management intervention on medication adherence and health outcomes in older people with multimorbidity. Design: A single-blind, two-arm randomised controlled trial. Settings: Three community health centres in Changsha, China. Participants: Older people with multimorbidity.Methods: A total of 136 participants were recruited and randomly allocated into either a 6-week nurse-led medication self-management intervention group (n = 67) or usual care group (n = 69). The intervention consisted of three one-on-one educational sessions on medication-related information, motivation and self-management skills and two follow-up phone calls. The primary outcome was medication adherence. Secondary outcomes included medication self-management capacity, treatment experiences, quality of life and utilisation of health care services. Outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. The intervention effects were assessed using generalised estimating equation models. Results: Statistically significant improvements were found in medication adherence (3 = 1.63, p = 0.034), medication knowledge (3 = 2.61, p < 0.001), beliefs about harm of medication (3 = -1.83, p < 0.001), medication selfefficacy (3 = 3.22, p < 0.001) and satisfaction with convenience of medication use (3 = 5.02, p = 0.005) for the intervention group compared with the control group immediately post-intervention. Compared with the control group at 3 months follow-up, the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in medication knowledge (3 = 2.26, p < 0.001), beliefs about necessity of medication (3 = 2.68, p = 0.002) and concerns about medication (3 = -2.44, p = 0.002), medication self-efficacy (3 = 1.87, p = 0.015) and medication burden (3 = -3.96, p = 0.004). Improved medication adherence was observed in the intervention group at 3 months follow-up compared with baseline, although the differences between the groups were not significant. No statistically significant effects were found on quality of life and utilisation of health care services at either time point.Conclusions: A 6-week medication self-management intervention significantly improved medication adherence immediately post-intervention, suggesting a short-term intervention effect. A longer intervention period and continuous follow-up support may be required to achieve sustained improvements in medication adherence and health outcomes in older people with multimorbidity.

AB This study aimed to predict the fall risk of community-dwelling seniors through fitness screening protocols and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, a customized questionnaire, simple functional performance tests (six items), and physical fitness tests (six items) were employed. A data processing was conducted to enhance the performance, including a deep neural network-based imputation approach (DataWig), an adaptive index filtration algorithm (multi-ReliefF), and decision tree (DT)-based prediction models. Historical data contained 215 community-dwelling seniors were used, and results showed that the proposed paradigm achieved promising and stable performance (e.g., accuracy: 0.933-0.950, F1-score: 0.951-0.955). The developed DT models presented satisfactory performance (top three in almost all evaluation metrics), and the utilized multi-ReliefF enhanced the accuracy (from 1.0% to 3.1%). These results indicated that the proposed paradigm could be a helpful tool for monitoring the health conditions of seniors during their daily exercises, which could help reduce the risk of falls.

AB While many researchers have called for housing to be addressed in age-friendly cities and communities, little research exists to guide communities through this process. To maximize the potential for adults to age in place, researchers partnered with a local Age-Friendly community initiative to conduct focus groups and learn more about residents' preferences related to housing and residential space. The focus group data offered a glimpse into aging residents' perspectives on housing to inform planning and development of housing in a mid-size city. This second phase of a sequential mixed methods study included qualitative focus groups with 19 aging individuals. Focus group sessions sought to better understand previously identified housing preferences, aging adults' sense of community, and their connection to place. Findings suggest that aging participants cared not only about the physical structure of their home, but also the community-based aspects of where they live. Study implications suggest that social workers, working with and alongside community members and aging-service providers who have local knowledge, can support age-friendly housing models that consider the housing preferences of older residents, as well as the resources and limitations of their community.

AB Background and Purpose: The Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) delivers community-based long-term care services to low-income, nursing home eligible adults. In the PACE population, one of the most common reasons for hospitalizations is falls. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to create a stakeholder-driven process for developing a fall risk screen and evaluate how well this process discriminated injurious and noninjurious fallers. Methods: The quality improvement design was a prospective, longitudinal data collection for 5 PACE programs in Colorado. Physical therapists collected the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) on participants at least annually. The Kotter practice change framework guided the processes for practice and organizational change in developing and implementing a fall screen. Results and Discussion: An iterative, stakeholder, and data-driven process allowed our team of researchers and a PACE program to establish a fall risk screen to stratify PACE participants. We provided feedback to PACE staff regarding screening rates and results on discrimination of faller status to promote continued uptake of screening and discussion regarding next steps. Rehabilitation therapists screened 66% of the PACE population, and participants were stratified into high risk (1-7 points) or low risk (8-12 points) based on the SPPB. Participants with low SPPB scores had 79% greater risk of a fall (risk ratio [RR] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.1) and 86% greater risk of an injurious fall (RR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.4), compared with those with high SPPB scores. Conclusions: Our study describes a collaboration to address fall rates in a PACE population. Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly clinicians can use the identified cut-offs to stratify PACE populations at risk for falls and allocate scarce rehabilitation resources efficiently to best serve participants at highest risk, while using less resource-intensive interventions for those at lower risk.

AB Objective The need for health and social care for community-dwelling elderly is on the rise as the population ages. Through the provision of comprehensive services by multiple professionals in local communities, elderly people can receive continual care in a non-medical setting, which is favorable for early detection and intervention of potential problems. However, the lack of digitalization in primary care affects the effectiveness of the services and precludes full exploitation of the data. This study proposed an information system dedicated to caring for community-dwelling elderly people and investigated its acceptance and usability. Methods An information system was designed for elderly care centers in the community, where data generated during care delivery, involving socio-demographic data, bio-measurements and health assessments and questionnaires, were digitized and stored for information management and exchange. A study was conducted to evaluate the acceptance and usability of the system after routine use of 6 months. The users of the system at an elderly care center were recruited to respond to a technology acceptance questionnaire and a system usability questionnaire. Results The mean scores of the acceptance and usability questionnaires reached 5.1 out of the highest possible score of 7. The constructs of the acceptance questionnaire had good reliability. The social influence and facilitating conditions constructs had a significant correlation with the behavioral intention construct. Conclusions The proposed information system demonstrated good acceptance and usability, which supported the feasibility of implementing it in community care centers for older adults. Further research will be conducted to address the limitation of sample size by extending the system to other elderly care centers, forming a large user base for a more in-depth and comprehensive performance evaluation.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop an interprofessional collaboration (IPC) scale for home health care for frail elderly. Methods: The first items of the IPC scale included collaboration members' attitudes, awareness, motivation, team strength, communication, relationships, information, care recipients' interests, effects, development, utilization of social resources, contributions to the community, and crisis management. The subjects were 512 care managers who work in home care support offices across Japan. They manage interprofessional collaboration in home health care for frail elderly who need care at 65 years old and above. The scale's construct validity, internal consistency, the validity of known groups, concurrent validity, and test-retest reliability (193 subjects) were examined. Results: The final IPC scale's items consisted of four factors (37 items): the strength of interprofessional teams (16), the management of collaborative systems (7), effects of collaboration (8), and communication (6). Four factors explained 58.6% of the total explained variance. The modified model fit of the scale achieved acceptable levels. The Cronbach's a coefficient for all items was .97. The sum of communication factor in the cities/wards group was lower than those in the towns/villages group. There were differences between the sum and each factor with different levels of ease to collaborate. The intraclass correlation coefficient for all items in the first and second assessments was .875. Conclusions: The validity and reliability of the IPC scale have been verified. This scale can be used to assess the IPC for home health care for frail elderly.

AB The use of technological means in the process of neuropsychological assessment has been proposed as a technique with promising results in the field of detection of neurocognitive disorders for community-dwelling older adults. Especially during the pandemic period due to COVID-19, telemedicine assumed to be vital in the field of early diagnosis of cognitive disorders and highlighted the clinical utility of remote methods of neuropsychological assessmentby video-conference. This descriptive study presents the development of a remote neuropsychological assessment protocol by selecting appropriate validated tests as part of a more comprehensive evaluation for older adults dwelling in the community. We recruited participants from the Athens Alzheimer's Association center in collaboration with the Hellenic Neuropsychological Society, in Athens, Greece, regarding the period between April 2020 and October 2021. 90 individuals, tested for the first time, were categorized into three groups according to their diagnosis which included: (a) Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), (b) Alzheimer's disease, (c) cognitively healthy older adults. The presented protocol outlines the main considerations of a framework about remote neuropsychological assessment, which can maximize the effectiveness of interventions and continuity regarding the care of older adults. The recommendations outlined in the presented protocol highlight strengths and limitations that should be taken into account in remote control procedures. Although the protocol was created in response to pandemic restrictions, tele-neuropsychology shows promise as a way to improve access opportunity to neurodiagnostic services for rural aging and underserved populations, which lack specialized healthcare services. Further application to different populations will add validity to the presented descriptive protocol.

ID RESIDENT
AB Objectives To explore the diabetes self-management expectations of older adults with diabetes, not yet accessing residential aged care services. Admission to residential aged care (RAC) can create many interruptions to usual food choices and diabetes self-management, and we know little about the concerns of the emerging ageing population. Methods This is a qualitative study employing focus groups and inductive thematic analysis involving 18 older adults with diabetes between the ages of 60 and 88, living in their own homes within an Australian city. Focus groups were recruited on a sequential basis and progressively analysed using an inductive process until data saturation was reached. Focus groups were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis. Results Three key themes were generated: autonomy, individualised dietary management and the food service system. Older adults speculated that they would want a collaborative approach to maintain their health in ageing and to self-manage their diabetes while feasible. Participants wanted autonomy over food choices, flexible meal timings and quality meals. There was a significant anxiety that aged care staff and existing food service systems in RAC could not support these preferences. Conclusions Community-dwelling older adults with diabetes would highly value aged care services that facilitated autonomy, individualised nutrition support and flexibility, but feared this will not be feasible. The introduction of new diabetes and RAC guidelines may require an implementation plan to include the full food service system, from staff education to meal preparation, ordering and service.

AB BackgroundMood disturbance is a pervasive problem affecting persons of all ages in the general population and the subset of those receiving services from different health care providers. interRAI assessment instruments comprise an integrated health information system providing a common approach to comprehensive assessment of the strengths, preferences and needs of persons with complex needs across the continuum of care. ObjectiveOur objective was to create new mood scales for use with the full suite of interRAI assessments including a composite version with both clinician-rated and self-reported items as well as a self-report only version. MethodsWe completed a cross-sectional analysis of 511,641 interRAI assessments of Canadian adults aged 18+ in community mental health, home care, community support services, nursing homes, palliative care, acute hospital, and general population surveys to develop, test, and refine new measures of mood disturbance that combined clinician and self-rated items. We examined validity and internal consistency across diverse care settings and populations. ResultsThe composite scale combining both clinician and self-report ratings and the self-report only variant showed different distributions across populations and settings with most severe signs of disturbed mood in community mental health settings and lowest severity in the general population prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The self-report and composite measures were strongly correlated with each other but differed most in populations with high rates of missing values for self-report due to cognitive impairment (e.g., nursing homes). Evidence of reliability was strong across care settings, as was convergent validity with respect to depression/mood disorder diagnoses, sleep disturbance, and self-harm indicators. In a general population survey, the correlation of the self-reported mood scale with Kessler-10 was 0.73. ConclusionsThe new interRAI mood scales provide reliable and valid mental health measures that can be applied across diverse populations and care settings. Incorporating a person-centered approach to assessment, the composite scale considers the person's perspective and clinician views to provide a sensitive and robust measure that considers mood disturbances related to dysphoria, anxiety, and anhedonia.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the association between age-friendliness of a city, loneliness and depression moderated by internet use among older people during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The survey was from 'The 2020 Survey of Needs Assessment for a Safe Community and Age-Friendly City' in Xinyi District, Taipei, which was conducted by face-to-face interviews with community-based older adults who were aged 65 and above from one district of Taipei City from May to June 2020 (n = 335). Partial least square structural equation modeling and the SPSS PROCESS macro were used for data analysis. Two domains of an age-friendly city (housing and community support and health services) were found to be associated with reduced loneliness, while one (respect and social inclusion) was associated with decreased depression. The age-friendliness of cities mitigates depression through moderator (internet use) and mediation (loneliness) mechanisms. Although some age-friendly domains of the city reduced loneliness and depression directly, the age-friendliness-loneliness-depression mechanism held true only for older adults who used the internet and not for nonusers. Maintaining the age-friendliness of an environment is beneficial to mental health, and internet use is a necessary condition to gain optimum benefits from age-friendly initiatives. Policy suggestions are discussed.

AB Background Elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation (EANF) impacts over five million community-dwelling older adults. Yet, no evidence-based intervention models exist that prevent EANF. Objectives In this article, we describe the assessment of process outcomes for a Community Complex Care Response Team (C3RT) model developed, via a practitioner-researcher partnership, to reduce instances of EANF victimization among higher risk community-dwelling older adults by identifying and coordinating their service needs. Specifically, we evaluated whether this C3RT approach produced more service coordination among providers (measured as documented interagency communications), more referrals for services, and more enrollment in services. Methods A pragmatic randomized control trial using a 1:1 randomization scheme allocated participants to either the C3RT intervention (N = 74) or standard practice (N = 72) group offered by a local Area Agency on Aging. Outcome data were extracted from the participants' administrative service records. Results The participants assigned to C3RT had significantly more interagency communications and services provided (p < 0.05) than those in standard practice. Conclusions Communications and services increased across a broad range of multidisciplinary services, which attend to the social determinants of health. This study is the first to use objective outcome measures to evaluate the processes of a coordinated community response approach systematically.

TI Prevalence of Polypharmacy and Factors Associated with it Among Saudi
   Older Adults - Results from the Saudi National Survey for Elderly Health
   (SNSEH)
SO SAUDI PHARMACEUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English

AB Background and Objectives: The percentage of Saudi older adults (SOA) is increasing over time. With advanced age, the prevalence of chronic diseases and multiple disabilities are increasing. This leads to increase utilization of multiple medications. The objectives of this study were to describe medication utilization, determine the prevalence of polypharmacy (PP) and factors associated with it among SOA.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among community-dwelling SOA aged >= 60 years old using the Saudi National Survey for Elderly Health (SNSEH). The survey was conducted between 2006 and 2007 by the Ministry of Health on a nationally representative sample of SOA. The data included demographics, socioeconomic and health information such as diseases and medications. Polypharmacy was defined as the concurrent use of medications from >= 5 therapeutic classes. A modified Poisson multivariable regression was used to study factors associated with PP controlling for confounders. All analyses were done using STATA 14.
   Results: The study included 2,946 SOA; 50.4% were males, 60.9% were 60-70 years old, and 69.6% were illiterate. The most common medications used among SOA were: Paracetamol (67%), joint pain medications and NSAIDs (50% each), anti-diabetic and multivitamins and minerals (47% each). PP was identified in (51.5%) of participants. The most medication associated with PP were: Paracetamol (79.9%), multivitamins and minerals (71.6%), steroid and DMARDs (70.1%), NSAIDs (66.4%), anti-diabetic and antihypertensive (61.3%). Higher risk of PP was associated with diabetes (RR: 1.863; 95% CI: 1.686-2.059), hypertension (RR: 1.829; 95% CI: 1.624-2.060), having pain (RR: 2.282; 95% CI: 1.918-2.713), urinary incontinence (RR: 1.389; 95% CI: 1.238-1.560; ref: no urinary incontinence) or suggestive depression (RR: 1.379; 95% CI: 1.259-1.512). Similarly, compared to low income (<2500 SAR), higher incomes were more likely to have PP. On the other hand, compared to the central region, southern and northern regions were less likely to have PP (RR = 0.741; 95% CI: 0.652-0.843 and RR: 0.736; 95% CI: 0.596-0.908, respectively). Severe cognitive impairment was associated with a lower risk of PP (RR: 0.708; 95% CI: 0.501-1.000).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of PP among a nationally representative SOA was very high, i.e., 51.5%. Higher risk of PP was associated with many factors such as region, income, diabetes, hypertension, musculoskeletal pain, urinary incontinence, and depression. PP leads to many negative implications such as drug interactions, combined side effects, hospitalization, and death. Therefore, raising the knowledge of health care providers on the consequences of PP and providing medication therapy management services may help decrease the negative consequences of PP and improve therapy outcomes.

AB Older Chinese adults' daily lives have been affected significantly during the outbreak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic since January 2020. They were confronted with activity restrictions due to strict pandemic prevention. The older population also had to get accustomed to widely-used modern technologies in community management, such as health codes and WeChat groups. By late 2021, mainland China had reduced the prevalence of COVID-19, and people's daily lives had primarily returned to pre-pandemic normality. Under China's systematic health management during the pandemic, older Chinese adults' responses to this nationwide public health emergency may have influenced their health in the long run. However, it remains unclear what specific health changes or improvements have occurred. Such a void in the literature is worrying, given that older adults are at high health risks due to the pandemic which, might still be with humankind for a while. Thus, it is of necessity to explore and report their health changes after this official, large-scale health intervention. In this study, 17 adults aged 55 and above were recruited as interviewees. All interviewees reside in a community located in Q district, N city of the People's Republic of China. According to the findings, many interviewees now have better literacy in health risk prevention. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) play a significant role in getting access to health information. Specifically, television, WeChat chatting groups, and TikTok could be valuable information sources for older adults. As for the understanding and evaluation of health information, although older participants can distinguish COVID-19 rumors, they may sometimes feel confused about the underlying scientific logic. Regarding changes in health behaviors and practices, many older adults can integrate health information and knowledge into their daily lives. Additionally, although interviewees can keep important social connections, not all of them are familiar with using new ICTs, such as online chatting group, for social participation and engagement. The empirical evidence suggests that both the communities and the local governments can offer specific training programs to older residents for the sake of enhancing their health literacy, health behaviors and practices, and social connectedness during and after the pandemic.

AB Background The increased number of older adults living alone has created a substantial care need. However, the utilization rate of services and facilities to meet these needs are surprisingly low. Many of older adults experience difficulties accessing these services, although it remains unclear how these obstacles impede access to services. This study explored the obstacles and difficulties experienced by urban older adults in seeking community care. Methods A phenomenological study was carried out and participatory observation and in-depth interviews were employed to investigate the process of seeking care of older adults in urban communities. A total of 18 urban community-dwelling older adults aged 75 years and over were included. Data collected were analysed by content analysis. Results We identified the pathways by which senior-only households sought community care and encountered obstacles. (1) lack of community care information: older adults did not know where and how to get services, even though the care institutions scattered throughout the community; (2) limited mobility: older adults often suffered from various chronic diseases, which physically hindered their access to care resources; (3) complex process of achieving care: the functional fragmentation and geographical dispersion of care institutions made the care-seeking process challenging and confusing for older adults; (4) incomprehension of needs expression: limited interaction time and communication barriers between staff of institutions and the older adults were the final obstacle. Only by surmounting these obstacles one by one can older adults access the care resources effectively. Conclusions When older adults in the community initiated calls for help, they encountered several obstacles. Their physiological and social disadvantages limited their ability to seek care physically. Lack of integration and clear guidance in the process of providing community care exacerbated these difficulties. Reform of care services should focus on the visibility and accessibility of services for older adults.

AB Purpose To describe types of mental health treatment accessed by community-based stroke survivors and factors associated with access. Methods A sub-group of registrants from the Australian Stroke Clinical Registry completed a supplementary survey 2.5 years post-stroke. Self-reported information about depression/anxiety and treatment access were collected. Demographic and clinical data were obtained through linkages with registry and government data. Staged multivariable logistic regression was conducted to examine factors associated with treatment access. Results Among 623 registrants surveyed (37% female, median age 69 years), 26% self-reported a medical diagnosis of depression/anxiety at 2.5 years post-stroke. Of these, only 30% reported having accessed mental health services, mostly through government-funded Medicare schemes. Younger age (odds ratio (OR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.93, 0.98), history of mental health treatment (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.35, 8.48), feeling socially isolated (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.16, 4.66), self-reported medical diagnosis of depression/anxiety (OR 4.85, 95% CI 2.32, 10.14), and government-subsidised team care plan arrangement (OR 4.05, 95% CI 1.96, 8.37) were associated with receiving treatment. Conclusions Many stroke survivors have untreated depression/anxiety. Primary care practitioners should be supported in undertaking effective detection and management. Older and newly diagnosed individuals should be educated about depression/anxiety and available supports.

TI 'Grey nomad' travellers' use of remote health services in Australia: a
   qualitative enquiry of hospital managers' perspectives

   remote; Grey nomads; Healthcare needs; Australia; Qualitative study
AB Background For more than the last two decades, older Australians travelling domestically in self-sufficient accommodation and recreational vehicles for extended periods of time have been referred to as 'Grey Nomads'. By 2021 more than 750,000 such recreational vehicles were registered in Australia. Tourism data for the year to September 2017 show 11.8 million domestic camping and caravanning trips in Australia, 29% of which were people aged 55 and over. As the 'baby boomer' generation increasingly comes to retirement, the size of this travelling population is growing. This term applies to the spike in birth rates after World War II from 1946-1964. This growing group of domestic travellers are potential healthcare consumers in remote areas but relatively little is known about their travel, healthcare needs or care seeking practices. Grey nomads have been described as reflective of the age-comparable sector of the Australian population in that many live with chronic illness. Early concerns were raised that they may "burden" already stretched rural and remote healthcare services but relatively little is known about the impact of these travellers. Methods The aim of this study was to explore the utilisation of healthcare services in remote locations in Australia by grey nomads including women travellers, from the perspective of healthcare professionals working in these settings. The study objective was to interview healthcare professionals to seek their experience and details of service delivery to grey nomads. In March 2020 [prior to state border closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic] a field study was conducted to identify the impact of grey nomads on healthcare services in remote New South Wales and Queensland. A qualitative approach was taken to explore the perspectives of nursing healthcare managers working in remote towns along a popular travel route. With appropriate Research Ethics Committee approval, managers were purposively sampled and sample size was determined by data saturation. Thirteen managers were contacted and twelve interviews were scheduled to take place face to face in the healthcare facilities (small hospitals with acute care and aged care services) at mutually convenient times. A semi-structured interview schedule was developed in line with the research aim. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and thematic analysis was undertaken concurrently with data collection for ongoing refinement of questions and to address emerging issues. Results These nursing managers described a strong service and community ethos. They regarded travellers' healthcare needs no differently to those of local people and described their strong commitment to the provision of healthcare services for their local communities, applying an inclusive definition of community. Traveller presentations were described as predominantly exacerbations of chronic illness such as chest pain, medication-related attendances, and accidents and injuries. No hospital activity data for traveller presentations were available as no reports were routinely generated. Travellers were reported as not always having realistic expectations about what healthcare is available in remote areas and arriving with mixed levels of preparedness. Most travellers were said to be well-prepared for their travel and self-management of their health. However, the healthcare services that can be provided in rural and remote areas needed to be better understood by travellers from metropolitan areas and their urban healthcare providers.
   Conclusion Participants did not perceive travellers as a burden on health services but recommendations were made regarding their expectations and preparedness. Australia's national transition to electronic health records including a patient-held record was identified as a future support for continuity of care for travellers and to facilitate treatment planning. With no current information to characterise traveller presentations, routinely collected hospital data could be extracted to characterise this patient population, their presentations and the resources required to meet their care needs.

ID CARE; IMPLEMENTATION; AUDIT
AB BACKGROUND. With an increasing elderly population, the number of persons with dementia is expected to increase and, consequently, the number of persons needing decision-making capacity assessments (DMCA) is too. However, many healthcare professionals do not feel ready to provide DMCAs. Since 2006, we implemented a DMCA Model that includes a care pathway, worksheets, education, and mentoring. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the utilization of this patient-centered DMCA model on the need for Capacity Interviews. METHODS. This was a retrospective quality assurance chart review of patients referred for DMCA to the Geriatric Service at the Grey Nuns Community Hospital from 2006-2020. The Geriatric Service is run by Family Physicians with extra training in Care of the Elderly. We extracted patient demographics, elements of the DMCA process, and whether Capacity Interviews were performed. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the data. RESULTS. Eighty-eight patients were referred for DMCAs, with a mean age of 76 years (SD = 10.5). Dementia affected 43.2% (38/88) of patients. Valid reasons for conducting a DMCA were evident in 93% (80/86) of referrals, and DMCAs were performed in 72.6% (61/84). 85.3% (58/68) of referrals identified the need for DMCA in two to four domains, most commonly accommodation, healthcare, and finances. Two to three disciplines, frequently social workers and occupational therapists, were involved in conducting the DMCAs for 67.2% (39/58) of patients. The Capacity Assessment Process Worksheet was used 63.2% of the time. Capacity Interviews were conducted in only 20.7% of referrals. Following the DMCAs, 48.2% (41/85) of those assessed were deemed to lack capacity. CONCLUSION. This study suggests that the DMCA Model implemented has decreased the need for Capacity Interviews while simultaneously respecting patient autonomy. This is an important finding as DMCAs carried out following this process reduced the need for both a Capacity Interview and declarations of incapacity while simultaneously respecting patient autonomy and supporting patients in their decisions in accordance with the legislation.

TI Artificial Intelligence-Based Smart Comrade Robot for Elders Healthcare
   with Strait Rescue System
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB A rising proportion of older people has more demand on services including hospitals, retirement homes, and assisted living facilities. Regaining control of this population's expectations will pose new difficulties for lawmakers, medical professionals, and the society at large. Smart technology can help older people to have independent and fulfilling lives while still living safely and securely in the community. In the last several decades, the number of sectors using robots has risen. Comrade robots have made their appearance in old human life, with the most recent notable appearance being in their care. The number of elderly individuals is increasing dramatically throughout the globe. The source of the story is the use of robots to help elderly people with day-to-day activities. Speech data and facial recognition model are done with AI model. Here, with the Comrade robotic model, elder people's healthcare system is designed with better analysis state. The aim is to put in place a simple robotic buddy to determine the health of the old person via a headband that has been given to them. Comrade robot may do things like senior citizens home automation, home equipment control, safety, and wellbeing sensing, and, in emergency situation, routine duties like navigating in the outside world. The fear that robotics and artificial intelligence would eventually eliminate most of the jobs is increasing. It is anticipated that, in order to survive and stay relevant in the constantly shifting environment of work, workers of the future will need to be creative and versatile and prepared to identify new business possibilities and change industry to meet challenges of the world. According to the research, reflective practice, time management, communicating, and collaboration are important in fostering creativity.

DT Article
ID TRANSGENDER; LIFE
AB This study investigated older trans people's experiences of health and social care, and the experiences and views of practitioners in order to inform service development. Sixteen trans adults aged over 50 from Cheshire and nearby were recruited via community organizations and interviewed individually or in focus groups. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed with consent. Health and social care service practitioners were interviewed remotely or face-to-face. Data were analyzed thematically supported by qualitative data analysis software. Three main themes were identified. 'Levers' indicated forces that influenced an individual's contact with health and or social care positively or negatively, and encompassed five sub-themes: age; experiences good or bad; family/close relationships; LGBT identity/communities; and money/finances. 'Contextual forces' encompassed societal forces that shape individuals' encounters in care, lack the potential for positive influence, and are more closely allied to stereotypes/myths: this theme included three sub-themes: discrimination/hate; ignorance; and risk from others. 'Positive practices' encompassed five sub-themes, including learning/training. In conclusion older age increases the importance of access to treatment for gender variance whilst simultaneously complicating it; older trans service users may be sensitive to potentially discriminatory experiences because of historical experiences; services should endeavor to understand individuals in the context of life history and psycho-social context; practitioners benefit from training in positive inclusive approaches to care; local community services are advantageous. Further research is needed with particular attention to social care, the experiences of trans men, and how to translate findings into person-centered practice, education and training.

TI Impact of pharmacist-led shared medication reviews on adherence among
   polymedicated older patients: an observational retrospective French
   study
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID METAANALYSIS; PHYSICIANS
AB Background: Inappropriate medication use or suboptimal medication adherence among polymedicated older patients is a public health concern. To tackle this issue, a pharmacist-led shared medication review (SMR) system was implemented in French community pharmacies in March 2018. SMR is an analysis of the drug treatments of the older patient with multiple medications. SMR takes place in the form of several interviews, at the pharmacy with the pharmacist, in a confidential space.
   Objectives: This observational real-world study evaluated the impact of the SMR service on medication adherence among polymedicated older patients in France. The risk of drug-related iatrogenic events in this population and the extent to which pharmacist SMR recommendations were followed by prescribers were also assessed.
   Methods: Data were collected using the Observia webtool made by Observia society, a purpose-built digital platform distributed nationwide to community pharmacies to facilitate the SMR process.
   Results: Data were analyzed from 439 patients (aged 65-75 years or older) who had completed their SMR at one of 297 French community pharmacies equipped with the Observia webtool. Overall, 186 patients had suboptimal adherence before SMR; 47% of these patients (n = 88) improved to have good adherence after completing the review. The rate of SMR-recommended prescription changes implemented by prescribers was low (14.7%; 38 of 258), with changes being implemented precisely as recommended in 47.4% of cases (n = 18). Potential iatrogenic events were identified in 20 patients.
   Conclusions: Although the SMR service is in the early stages of implementation in France, this study revealed that the process had a positive impact on medication adherence among older polymedicated patients. However, improvements are needed to reinforce prescriber and patient confidence in the system and further improve health outcomes. (C) 2022 American Pharmacists Association (R).

AB Machine learning has been applied in healthcare domain for the development of smart devices to improve the life of the elderly persons in the society. Taking care of elderly person in the society is a critical issue that need automation. To proffer solution, many researchers developed deep learning algorithms smart devices for detecting elderly behavior to improve the elderly healthcare. Despite the progress made in the applications of deep learning algorithms in elderly healthcare systems, to the best of the author's knowledge no comprehensive recent development has been published on this interesting research area especially focusing on deep learning. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive recent development on the advances, methods and real world applications on developing smart devices for detecting elderly behavior for use in smart home, smart clinic, smart hospital and smart elderly nursing home for elderly person's healthcare. Theories of the deep learning algorithms, recent development recorded as regard to the applicability of deep learning in elderly healthcare systems and case studies were discussed. A taxonomy based on the data extracted from the applicability of deep learning algorithms in elderly healthcare systems is created to ease pointing out areas that need more attention. The article shows that the deep learning algorithm that received tremendous attention from researchers is convolutional neural network architecture and its variants. To help in future development of the research area, we highlighted the challenges associated to the applicability of deep learning algorithms in elderly healthcare system and pointed out new point of view for future research. The research community can use our review as a benchmark for proposing novel deep learning algorithms based smart devices to detect elderly behavior for elderly healthcare systems. Industries and organizations can use the paper as a guide in selecting machine learning based smart device for detecting elderly behavior for elderly healthcare support.

AB SIGNIFICANCE We know the prevalence of traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related vision impairment and ocular injury symptoms. Lacking is an understanding of health care utilization to treat these symptoms. Utilization knowledge is important to structuring access to treatment, identifying clinical training needs, and providing evidence of the effectiveness of treatment. PURPOSE This article reports rehabilitation, glasses/contacts, and imaging/photography/video recommendations made by optometrists and ophthalmologists as part of the Department of Veterans Affairs-mandated Performance of Traumatic Brain Injury Specific Ocular Health and Visual Functioning Examination administered to veterans with TBI at Department of Veterans Affairs polytrauma specialty facilities. METHODS Using a retrospective design, natural language processing, and descriptive and regression statistics, data were analyzed for 2458 Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans who were administered the mandated examination between 2008 and 2017. RESULTS Of the 2458 veterans, vision rehabilitation was recommended for 24%, glasses/contacts were recommended for 57%, and further imaging/photography/video testing was recommended for 58%. Using key words in the referral, we determined that 37% of veterans were referred to blind rehabilitation, 16% to occupational therapy, and 3% to low-vision clinics. More than 50% of the referrals could have been treated by blind rehabilitation, occupational therapy, or low-vision clinics. Rehabilitation referrals were significantly associated with younger age, floaters, photosensitivity, double vision, visual field and balance deficits, dizziness, and difficulty reading. In comparison, prescriptions for glasses and contacts were associated with older age, photosensitivity, blurred vision, decreased visual field and night vision, difficulty reading, and dry eye. Imaging/photography/video testing was associated with floaters, photosensitivity, and headache. CONCLUSIONS Findings delineate service delivery models available to veterans with TBI-related vision impairment. The challenge these data address is the lack of clear paths from diagnosis of TBI to identification of vision dysfunction deficits to specialized vision rehabilitation, and finally to community reintegration and community based-vision rehabilitation.

AB Objectives: People are living longer with complex health needs and wish to remain in their homes as their care needs change. We examined which client factors (sociodemographic, health service use, health, and function) influenced older persons' (>= 65 years) time to transition from home living to assisted living (AL) or long-term care (LTC) facilities.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting and Participants: Long-term services and supports in Alberta, Canada. Long-stay home care clients (>= 65 years) who received a Resident Assessment InstrumenteHome Care (RAI-HC) assessment between 2014 and 2018.
   Measures: We assessed time from initial receipt of long-term home care to AL and LTC facility transitions, using Cox proportional hazard regressions, and a provincial continuing care data repository (Alberta Continuing Care Information System). We adjusted for client sociodemographic, health, function, and health service use variables. The outcome was time from initial long-term home care receipt to transition to facility living.
   Results: We included 33,432 home care clients. Clients who were visited by care aides once in the last 7 days transitioned to AL later than those with no care aide visits [hazard ratio (HR) 0.976, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.852, 0.964]. Clients receiving physical therapy services once or more a week transitioned to LTC later than those who did not receive these services (HR 0.767, CI 0.672, 0.875). Institutionalizations happened sooner if the client's caregiver was unable to continue (AL: HR 1.335, CI 1.306, 1.365; LTC: HR 1.339, CI 1.245, 1.441) and if clients socialized less (AL: HR 1.149, CI 1.079, 1.223; LTC: HR 1.087, CI 1.018, 1.61).
   Conclusions and Implications: The diverse role of care aides needs to be explored to determine which specific services help to delay AL transitions. Physical therapy exercises that require minimal supervision should be integrated early into care plans to delay LTC transitions. Social/recreational programs to improve older adults' socialization and informal caregiver support could delay transitions.

AB Objectives: Given the widely acknowledged benefits of intergenerational programs (IGPs), we compared processes and structures across different IGP types and explored potential areas for improvement. Design: Thirteen IGPs were classified into three types: arts, learning, and assistance programs. Data were collected through direct structured interviews and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Setting: Participants were recruited from community-based IGPs in the greater Tel Aviv area of Israel. Participants: Eighty-four older participants (OPs), 97 younger participants (YPs), and 21 organizers were interviewed. Measurements: Questions included participant demographics as well as closed- and open-ended questions regarding processes based on the Impact of Intergenerational Programs Questionnaire (IIPQ). Analysis: Responses to closed-ended questions were compared among IGP types and age groups using two-way ANOVAs for ordinal data, and chi-squares for nominal data. Responses to open-ended questions by OP, YP, and program organizers about potential areas for improvement were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Processes in need of improvement were preparation and guidance, length of program participation, and monitoring of activities, which differed across IGP types and age groups. These processes were related to broader structural problems such as lack of resources, organizers' poor employment conditions, and inadequate public services for older persons in Israel. Conclusions: Our study highlights the complex relationships between IGP types, processes, and structures. IGP processes and goals can be hindered by structural variables such as insufficient funding, infrastructure, and public services for older adults.

AB With the increasingly serious aging problem, getting around in communities has become an important means of socializing for older adults. This study proposes a new community aging-friendly transportation service system from the perspective of service design, so as to help realize the sustainable development of community services. To achieve this objective, the pain points and demands of older adults while traveling in communities were collected through a questionnaire survey, focus group interview, and user journey map. In addition, the grounded theory was applied to encode the qualitative data obtained in the focus group interview, so as to explore the path composition and dimension connotation of designing community transportation services. Based on the research results, we found that service strategy, service foundation, service support, and service effect are the key factors influencing customized transportation services. The established model covers the design framework of the service system, customized traffic service process, design strategy of community stakeholders, and traffic service system diagram. These research results provide references for community managers, community service providers, and designers.

AB As the global population of older people increases, policies aimed at improving health care delivery for older people often include supports for ageing in place. Living in the community not only reduces institutionalisation but also improves quality of life and reduces health care costs. For older people, community rehabilitation offers the opportunity to preserve and maximise function while maintaining the ability to live in the community. However, limited research examines the delivery, coordination and integration of community rehabilitation services in health systems. Our case study explored the perspectives of service providers, managers and health system administrators on the strengths, limitations and gaps in community rehabilitation for older people in one Canadian urban health region. Using interpretive description and thematic analysis, we analysed interview data from: 16 service providers, eight managers and five health system administrators. Three themes were identified: (a) Limited Access to Programs and Services; (b) Need to Emphasise Promoting, Maintaining and Restoring Function; and (c) Lack of Flow Across the System. Participants highlighted that restrictive eligibility criteria limited access to services. Services were organised around health conditions that did not address the needs of older people. Long wait-lists meant that services were delayed. Transportation costs limited participation of individuals from lower socioeconomic status (SES). Age restrictions did not reflect differences in the ageing process and the health inequities individuals from lower SES groups experienced. There was a lack of emphasis in community rehabilitation programs on maintaining or restoring function in older people, which is the primary focus of rehabilitation. Furthermore, key stakeholders stressed the need for strengthening the integration of service delivery across the continuum of care. The findings underscore the need to develop a conceptual framework for community rehabilitation to promote greater system integration, access and availability of services and to optimise functional outcomes for older people.

AB Transitioning towards community-based alternatives for service provision, health geographers have turned their gaze towards the changing meanings of place across dynamic landscapes for older people. Yet, little is known about how such a transition has manifested as a new phenomenon in a non-western country, within a variegated geo-historical context. Using a relational approach, this paper examines what it means to embed care services in a community for supporting aging-in-place through a new model, community-based care centre (CBCC) in Beijing, China. Interview data were obtained from 47 participants (including administrative staff, service providers, and older people) to understand how stakeholders envision the transition towards the CBCC model. Our findings show that embedding CBCCs into communities is a three-dimensional process: 1) the dynamics of locating services and socio-relational distance in shaping a sense of place; 2) the blurring of formal and informal care relations in creating care spaces; and 3) the interweaving of collectivism and individualism in a transition from "work-unit" to community. These interactions indicate that community-embedded care is geographically, socially, politically, and culturally constructed and needs to be understood as dynamic and relational. Our findings suggest that the theoretical underpinnings of aging-in-place need to broaden to include non-western perspectives.

AB Background In the UK, about 14% of community-dwelling adults aged 65 and over are estimated to be at risk of malnutrition. Screening older adults in primary care and treating those at risk may help to reduce malnutrition risk, reduce the resulting need for healthcare use and improve quality of life. Interventions are needed to raise older adults' risk awareness, offer relevant and meaningful strategies to address risk and support general practices to deliver treatment and support. Methods Using the Person-based Approach and input from Patient and Public Involvement representatives, we developed the 'Eat well, feel well, stay well' intervention. The intervention was optimised using qualitative data from think aloud and semi-structured process evaluation interviews with 23 and 18 older adults respectively. Positive and negative comments were extracted to inform rapid iterative modifications to support engagement with the intervention. Data were then analysed thematically and final adjustments made, to optimise the meaningfulness of the intervention for the target population. Results Participants' comments were generally positive. This paper focuses predominantly on participants' negative reactions, to illustrate the changes needed to ensure that intervention materials were optimally relevant and meaningful to older adults. Key factors that undermined engagement included: resistance to the recommended nutritional intake among those with reduced appetite or eating difficulties, particularly frequent eating and high energy options; reluctance to gain weight; and a perception that advice did not align with participants' specific personal preferences and eating difficulties. We addressed these issues by adjusting the communication of eating goals to be more closely aligned with older adults' beliefs about good nutrition, and acceptable and feasible eating patterns. We also adjusted the suggested tips and strategies to fit better with older adults' everyday activities, values and beliefs. Conclusions Using iterative qualitative methods facilitated the identification of key behavioural and contextual elements that supported engagement, and issues that undermined older adults' engagement with intervention content. This informed crucial revisions to the intervention content that enabled us to maximise the meaningfulness, relevance and feasibility of the key messages and suggested strategies to address malnutrition risk, and therefore optimise engagement with the intervention and the behavioural advice it provided.

TI Guidance for hospital and community-based health services for older
   adults: The senior friendly care framework
SO ARCHIVES OF GERONTOLOGY AND GERIATRICS
LA English

DE Senior friendly care; sfCare; Framework; Hospital/community integration;
   Health services for older adults
AB To meet the needs of a population of older adults at risk of becoming frail in the context of known limitations to current practice, frameworks have emerged to guide health service development. Typically these frameworks have developed in the hospital sector despite the need for hospital/community sector co-development and adoption. In the present study one such framework - the Senior Friendly Hospital (SFH1) Framework - is examined with an intersectoral lens.
   The study included a scoping review of literature addressing system-based approaches to improving healthcare of older people as well as a modified Delphi process to incorporate these findings into an expanded framework. Qualitative analysis of the data extracted from the scoping review resulted in the identification of "senior friendly" excerpts that were charted using an apriori matrix provided by the SFH Framework. Researchers conducted thematic analysis of the excerpts to avoid redundancy and wrote statements to optimize thematic clarity. In a modified Delphi process, the statements were subsequently rated for perceived importance, clarity and fit by an intersectoral panel of experts resulting in a refined Senior Friendly Care (sfCare2) Framework comprising 31 statements and 7 guiding principles to consider when implementing improvements in the care of older adults. Finally, a panel of stakeholders were consulted for feedback on the clarity of the framework's intent and its anticipated impact on care. The sfCare Framework is now available to guide hospital and community based health service development for older adults.

AB In recent years, nurses have developed projects in the area of hospital to community transition. The objective of the present study was to analyze the transitional care offered to elderly people after they used emergency services and were discharged to return to the community. The action research method was chosen. The participants were nurses, elderly people 70 years old or older, and their caregivers. The study was carried out from October 2018 to August 2019. The data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews with the nurses, analysis of medical records, participatory observation, phone calls to the elderly people and caregivers, and team meetings. The qualitative data were submitted to Bardin's content analysis. Statistical treatment was carried out by applying SPSS version 23.0. The institution's research ethics committee approved the research. Only 31.4% of the sample experienced care continuity after discharge, and the rate of readmission to emergency services during the first 30 days after discharge was 33.4%. The referral letters lacked data on information provided to patients or caregivers, and nurses mentioned difficulties in communication between care levels, as well as obstacles to teamwork; they also mentioned that the lack of health policies and clinical rules to formalize transitional care between the hospital and the community perpetuated non-coordination of care between the two contexts. The low level of literacy of patients and their relatives are mentioned as a cause for not understanding the information regarding seeking primary health care services and handing the discharge letter. It was concluded that there is an urgent need to mobilize health teams toward action in the patients' process of returning home, and this factor must be taken into account in care planning.

DT Article
AB In the current big data environment, science and technology not only provide a new governance model for rural community governance but also put forward higher requirements for rural community governance level. Under the background of rural revitalization, promoting the construction of rural community cultural service system is not only an important choice to realize the equalization of urban and rural basic public services but also an important way to protect the cultural rights and interests of rural residents. On the basis of analyzing the real-time data of social media, this paper studies the design and implementation method of rural community culture platform and then puts forward the strategy of community public culture informatization construction under the background of aging. From a global perspective, all countries have their own ways and means to invest in public cultural services. Especially from the perspective of countries with better development of public cultural services, multichannel funding sources are an important indicator of the quality of cultural undertakings. With the development of China's social economy, the rural endowment insurance system is becoming more and more perfect, and the basic living needs of the elderly are basically met.

AB There are over 2,300 care homes in the North East and Yorkshire Region, with rising rates of COVID-19 infection in April 2020. The Enhanced Universal Support Offer (EUSO) planned to improve support to care homes, working collaboratively with local integrated community services. Implementation was organised at 'place', through clinical commissioning and it was focused on leadership, prevention, additional clinical support, and workforce planning. The aim of the evaluation research was to understand the impact of the EUSO. The evaluation was co-produced by a group of senior leaders with additional academic involvement. An appreciative inquiry approach informed the interviews and focus groups with representative stakeholders. A thematic analysis using NVivo enabled a validation process and the data were charted into a systems framework. Data analysis resulted in five high level themes: Communication, Working Relationships, Systemic Perceptions, COVID-19 Implementation, and Organisational Support. Best practices were associated with joint working between health, local authority and care homes including medication optimisation and technology use. Care homes valued access to a named General Practitioner and community nursing working as a part of a wider multidisciplinary team. Conversely an overly reactive response to care homes combined with 'command and control' limited the benefits that were achieved. The EUSO was delivered at pace and resulted in an increased appreciation of the policy and principles of care home residents and workforce. The evaluation reflected a need to appreciate the care homes' knowledge and experience of resident wellbeing, and more fully involve them in the design of the support.

AB Background The aim of this study was to inform the development of a Community Geriatrics Service (CGS) that addressed the healthcare and social needs of community dwelling older people in an Australian context. Methods Stakeholders (N = 108) took part in a 'needs assessment' involving 30-min semi-structured interviews with general practitioners (GPs; N = 49), and three 2-h focus groups (community engagement meetings; N = 59) with older people, informal caregivers, allied healthcare workers, and nursing home directors. Data were transcribed and thematically coded, mapped to source and weighted to the frequency that the theme was raised across sources. Results Five themes informing CGS development and delivery emerged: active health conditions (management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, falls, multimorbidity, and other relevant conditions), active social challenges (patient non-compliance, need for aged care social workers, caregiver stress, elder abuse, social isolation, and stigma), referrals (availability of specialists, communication, specialist input, and advance care directives), access (lack of transport options, and inaccessibility of local geriatrics clinics and specialists), and awareness (lack of awareness, knowledge, and resources). Conclusions The CGS will need to address access, referral processes and health system navigation, which were perceived by stakeholders as significant challenges. These findings warrant the development of a CGS with an integrated approach to aged care, pertinent for the health and social needs of the elderly.

AB Objective: This study aims for a greater understanding of how older adults (age 65 and older) in Jackson County, Florida, are prepared for and cope with the effects of a natural disaster.
   Methods: A multidisciplinary, international research team developed a survey examining: (1) resources available to individuals aged 65+ in rural communities for preparing for a disaster; (2) challenges they face when experiencing a disaster; and (3) their physical, social, emotional, and financial needs when it strikes. The survey was administered with older adults (65+) in Jackson County, Florida, following Hurricane Michael in 2018. The descriptive, multivariate logistic, and linear regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between respondents' demographic information and needs, concerns, and consequences of disaster.
   Results: Results indicated (n = 139) rural community-dwelling older adults rely on social support, community organizations, and trusted disaster relief agencies to prepare for and recover from disaster-related events.
   Conclusions: Such findings can be used to inform the development of new interventions, programs, policies, practices, and tools for emergency management and social service agencies to improve disaster preparedness and resiliency among older populations in rural communities.

AB Background: As health resources and services are increasingly delivered through digital platforms, eHealth literacy is becoming a set of essential capabilities to improve consumer health in the digital era. To understand eHealth literacy needs, a meaningful measure is required. Strong initial evidence for the reliability and construct validity of inferences drawn from the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ) was obtained during its development in Denmark, but validity testing for varying purposes is an ongoing and cumulative process.
   Objective: This study aims to examine validity evidence based on relations to other variables-using data collected with the known-groups approach-to further explore if the eHLQ is a robust tool to understand eHealth literacy needs in different contexts. A priori hypotheses are set for the expected score differences among age, sex, education, and information and communication technology (ICT) use for each of the 7 eHealth literacy constructs represented by the 7 eHLQ scales.
   Methods: A Bayesian mediated multiple indicators multiple causes model approach was used to simultaneously identify group differences and test measurement invariance through differential item functioning across the groups, with ICT use as a mediator. A sample size of 500 participants was estimated. Data were collected at 3 diverse health sites in Australia.
   Results: Responses from 525 participants were included for analysis. Being older was significantly related to lower scores in 4 eHLQ scales, with 3. Ability to actively engage with digital services having the strongest effect (total effect -0.37; P<.001), followed by 1. Using technology to process health information (total effect -0.32; P<.001), 5. Motivated to engage with digital services (total effect -0.21; P=.01), and 7. Digital services that suit individual needs (total effect -0.21; P=.02). However, the effects were only partially mediated by ICT use. Higher education was associated with higher scores in 1. Using technology to process health information (total effect 0.22; P=.01) and 3. Ability to actively engage with digital services (total effect 0.25; P<.001), with the effects mostly mediated by ICT use. Higher ICT use was related to higher scores in all scales except 2. Understanding health concepts and language and 4. Feel safe and in control. Either no or ignorable cases of differential item functioning were found across the 4 groups.
   Conclusions: By using a Bayesian mediated multiple indicators multiple causes model, this study provides supportive validity evidence for the eHLQ based on relations to other variables as well as established evidence regarding internal structure related to measurement invariance across the groups for the 7 scales in the Australian community health context. This study also demonstrates that the eHLQ can be used to gain valuable insights into people's eHealth literacy needs to help optimize access and use of digital health and promote health equity.

AB Background Clinical uncertainty is inherent for people with frailty and multimorbidity. Depleted physiological reserves increase vulnerability to a decline in health and adverse outcomes from a stressor event. Evidence-based tools can improve care processes and outcomes, but little is known about priorities to deliver care for older people with frailty and multimorbidity. This study aimed to explore the preferences and priorities for patients, family carers and healthcare practitioners to enhance care processes of comprehensive assessment, communication and continuity of care in managing clinical uncertainty using evidence-based tools. Methods A parallel mixed method observational study in four inpatient intermediate care units (community hospitals) for patients in transition between hospital and home. We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to examine patient and family preferences and priorities on the attributes of enhanced services; and stakeholder consultations with practitioners to discuss and generate recommendations on using tools to augment care processes. Data analysis used logit modelling in the DCE, and framework analysis for consultation data. Results Thirty-three patients participated in the DCE (mean age 84 years, SD 7.76). Patients preferred a service where family were contacted on admission and discharge (beta 0.36, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.61), care received closer to home (beta - 0.04, 95% CI - 0.06 to - 0.02) and the GP is fully informed about care (beta 0.29, 95% CI 0.05-0.52). Four stakeholder consultations (n = 48 participants) generated 20 recommendations centred around three main themes: tailoring care processes to manage multiple care needs for an ageing population with frailty and multimorbidity; the importance of ongoing communication with patient and family; and clear and concise evidence-based tools to enhance communication between clinical teams and continuity of care on discharge. Conclusion Family engagement is vital to manage clinical uncertainty. Both patients and practitioners prioritise engaging the family to support person-centred care and continuity of care within and across care settings. Patients wished to maximise family involvement by enabling their support with a preference for care close to home. Evidence-based tools used across disciplines and services can provide a shared succinct language to facilitate communication and continuity of care at points of transition in care settings.

AB Background: In Taiwan, the Chiayi City Government and Industrial Development Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs have worked together to promote smart health management in the community and encourage people to use the intelligent physical health measurement system (IPHMS) with Smart Body Health Measuring Machine. Volunteers help participants in the community to use the IPHMS to ensure that measurements are taken correctly. Objectives: This study aimed to explore volunteers' satisfaction with using the IPHMS and the effects of the measurement service on the participants' measurement behavior intention, and further explore the impact on their active aging. Methods: This study used a paper questionnaire to survey both the participants of the measurement service and the community volunteers from March to April 2021. A total of 180 valid responses were collected. Results: The sociodemographic information showed that the volunteers were mostly female, were aged over 61 years old, had received junior college education, had spent less than 3-6 years in community service, and had 6 months to 1 year of measured service experience. Additionally, the participants of the measurement service were mostly female, were aged over 61 years old, had received below middle school education, had spent less than 1-3 years in community service, and spent an average of 5 days in the community each week. Our results showed that the information quality (beta = 0.352, p < 0.001) and system quality (beta = 0.701, p < 0.001) had significant effects on volunteers' satisfaction of using the IPHMS. Subjective norms had significant effects on participants' perceived disease threat (beta = 0.347, p < 0.001) and behavior intention of management service (beta = 0.701, p < 0.001); furthermore, behavior intention had significant effects on their social participation for active aging (beta = 0.430, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Improving the system and information quality is likely to improve volunteers' satisfaction with the system. Active aging factors only affect social participation, which represents the measurement services promote for social interaction mostly.

DE Home based care; Aging; Disaster; Health care quality
ID PREPAREDNESS; EVACUATION
AB Background Home based care is a vital, and growing, part of the health care system that allows individuals to remain in their homes while still receiving health care. During a disaster, when normal health care systems are disrupted, home based care remains a vital source of support for older adults. The purpose of this paper is to qualitatively understand the barriers and facilitators of both patients and providers that influence the provision of home based care activities in two hurricane affected communities. Methods Using qualitative inquiry informed by the social ecological model, five focus groups were conducted with home based care providers (n = 25) in two settings affected by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey. An open-source database of home health agencies participating in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services programs was used to identify participants. Data were manually coded and larger themes were generated from recurring ideas and concepts using an abductive analysis approach. Results Twenty five participants were included in one of five focus groups. Of the 22 who responded to the demographic survey, 65 % were registered nurses, 20 % were Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN), and 15 % were other types of health care providers. 12 % of the sample was male and 88 % was female. Five themes were identified in the analysis: barriers to implementing preparedness plans, adaptability of home based care providers, disasters exacerbate inequalities, perceived unreliability of government and corporations, and the balance between caring for self and family and caring for patients. Conclusions This study provides qualitative evidence on the factors that influence home based care provision in disaster-affected communities, including the barriers and facilitators faced by both patients and providers in preparing for, responding to and recovering from a disaster. While home based care providers faced multiple challenges to providing care during and after a disaster, the importance of community supports and holistic models of care in the immediate period after the disaster were emphasized. We recommend greater inclusion of home health agencies in the community planning process. This study informs the growing body of evidence on the value of home based care in promoting safety and well-being for older adults during a disaster.

ID EFFICACY
AB Background and Objectives Care planning can protect against or offset potential stressors in the caregiving stage and mitigate their detrimental effects. This study aimed to translate, adapt, and validate 2 short forms of the multidimensional, theory-guided scale measuring preparation for future care needs (PFCN) among Chinese older adults in Hong Kong. Research Design and Methods Data were derived from a cross-sectional survey of 862 community-dwelling individuals aged 60 years and older. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted to assess the structural validity of the scales. Criterion-related validity, known-groups validity, and internal consistency were also examined. Results EFA yielded a 14-item 4-factor (awareness, avoidance, decision making, and concrete planning) model, which was supported by CFA and explained 68.9% of the total variance. CFA also supported the structural validity of the 5-item scale. Criterion-related validity of the 2 scales was supported by their significant and positive correlations with domain-specific planning behaviors for retirement. Known-groups validity of the 2 scales was demonstrated by significant differences in scores between male and female older adults and scores between different educational levels and socioeconomic status. Cronbach's alphas for the internal consistency of the 14-item and 5-item scales were 0.889 and 0.774, respectively. Discussion and Implications PFCN scales enable researchers and service practitioners to accurately understand and assess older adults' processes and efforts in care planning, facilitate the identification of individuals at risk from inadequate planning, and inform the development of interventions to enhance care preparation in target domains.

AB Objectives: To investigate functional health literacy and its associated factors among older adults drawn from a disadvantaged area. Design: Crosssectional epidemiologic study. Setting: Population-based cohort randomly selected from the voter registration lists. Participants: Individuals aged 65+ (N=1066). Measurements: The Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA); demographics; self-rated health; number of prescription drugs; modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale; Mini-Mental State Examination; Wechsler Test of Adult Reading; Clinical Dementia Rating; cognitive domain composite scores; independence in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and medication management; health services utilization (emergency/urgent care visits and hospitalizations). Results: Low (inadequate or marginal) S-TOFHLA scores were obtained by 7.04% of the sample. In unadjusted analyses, participants with low S-TOFHLA scores were significantly more likely than those with higher scores to be older, male, nonWhite, with lesser education and lower household income, to have lower scores on the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and all cognitive domains; to be more dependent in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and be taking more prescription drugs. In a multiple regression model including all covariates, only older age, male sex, and lower reading level were independently associated with inadequate or marginal STOFHLA scores. Conclusion: In a population-based sample of older adults, low functional health literacy was associated with age, sex, education, and reading ability. Basic functional health literacy is essential for understanding health information and instructions. Clinicians should formally or informally assess health literacy in their older patients to ensure effective communication and enhance health outcomes.

AB Falls among older people are highly prevalent, serious and costly, and translation of evidence about falls prevention needs to occur urgently. GPs can identify older people at risk of falling and put preventative measures in place before a fall. Because GPs are key to identifying older people at risk of falls and managing falls risk, this study explored how GPs adapted to the iSOLVE (Integrated SOLutions for sustainable falls preVEntion) process to embed evidence-based falls prevention strategies within primary care, and whether and how they changed their practice. A theoretically informed qualitative study using normalisation process theory was conducted in parallel to the iSOLVE trial to elicit GPs' views about the iSOLVE process. Data were coded and a thematic analysis of interview transcripts was conducted using constant comparison between the data and themes as they developed. In all, 24 of 32 eligible GPs (75%) from general practices located in the North Sydney Primary Health Network, Australia, were interviewed. Six themes were identified: (1) making it easy to ask the iSOLVE questions; (2) internalising the process; (3) integrating the iSOLVE into routine practice; (4) addressing assumptions about patients and fall prevention; (5) the degree of change in practice; and (6) contextual issues influencing uptake. The iSOLVE project focused on practice change, and the present study indicates that practice change is possible. How GPs addressed falls prevention in their practice determined the translation of evidence into everyday practice. Support tools for falls prevention must meet the needs of GPs and help with decision making and referral. Fall prevention can be integrated into routine GP practice through the iSOLVE process to tailor fall risk management.

AB Background: Between 2015 and 2050, the aging population of Uganda (aged 50 years and older) will be nearly doubled. Therefore, later-life problems have become an area of increasing research and policy interest. This study aimed at exploring how aging people living in extreme poverty in a low-income country experience their everyday life and what kind of meaning systems employed by them to understand and cope with their living conditions.
   Methods: We conducted a qualitative interview with 14 participants in the Buikwe district. In this interview, 11 women and 3 men were included, and a thematic analysis was employed for data processing and analysis.
   Results: Unanimously, all participants reported their condition as extreme poverty. The key informants (KIs) emphasized respect from descendants and the community as a foundation for a meaningful later life. In contrast, this aspect has been ever mentioned by no caregivers but by only one care-receiver. The willingness/ability of children to support the elderly who are in need of support formed a major part of the reflections of care-receivers, which would be decisive for their position in the society and the respect they would receive. In addition, both Christianity and traditional beliefs as well as beliefs in witchcraft and ancestral spirits were employed as a basis for actions and reflections.
   Discussion: The question arises whether life in extreme poverty conditions can be perceived as meaningful. Respect was mentioned as fundamental by the KIs, thereby giving priority to social relations as the most meaningful factor for living a meaningful life. The ability and willingness of the possible descendants for support as the focus of care-receivers might be a more down-to-earth description of this aspect but without using the same level of abstraction. For the majority, due to their belief system did not serve as a source of consolation their main focus was on social relationships for support. To improve the wellbeing of the old people, their sense of meaning must be restored through a system, guaranteeing the coverage of basic needs and measures to restore dignity through a reintegration in both community and congregations. Social service agencies who are targeting the elderly people need to work toward this objective.

AB Societal challenges associated with caring for the physical and mental health of older adults worldwide have grown at an unprecedented pace, increasing demand for health-care services and technologies Despite the development of several assistive systems tailored to older adults, the rate of adoption of health technologies is low. This review discusses the ethical and acceptability challenges resulting in low adoption of health technologies specifically focused on smart homes for older adults. The findings have been structured in two categories: Ethical Considerations (Privacy, Social Support, and Autonomy) and Technology Aspects (User Context, Usability, and Training). The findings conclude that older adults community is more likely to adopt assistive systems when four key criteria are met. The technology should: be personalized toward their needs, protect their dignity and independence, provide user control, and not be isolating. Finally, we recommend researchers and developers working on assistive systems to: (1) provide interfaces via smart devices to control and configure the monitoring system with feedback for the user, (2) include various sensors/devices to architect a smart home solution in a way that is easy to integrate in daily life, and (3) define policies about data ownership.

TI A Novel Use of NEMSIS to Create a PECARN-Specific EMS Patient Registry
SO PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
LA English
DT Article
DE EMS; pediatric; data
ID EMERGENCY MEDICAL-SERVICES; NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS
AB Background: Research networks need access to EMS data to conduct pilot studies and determine feasibility of prospective studies. Combining data across EMS agencies is complicated and costly. Leveraging the National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) to extract select agencies' data may be an efficient and cost-effective method of providing network-level data. Objective: Describe the process of creating a Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) specific NEMSIS data set and determine if these data were nationally representative. Methods: We established data use agreements (DUAs) with EMS agencies participating in PECARN to allow for agency identification through NEMSIS. Using 2019 NEMSIS version 3.4.0 data for EMS events with patients 18 years old and younger, we compared PECARN NEMSIS data to national NEMSIS data. Analyzed variables were selected for their ability to characterize events. No statistical analyses were utilized due to the large sample, instead, differences of +/- 5% were deemed clinically meaningful. Results: DUAs were established for 19 EMS agencies, creating a PECARN data set with 305,188 EMS activations of which 17,478 (5.7%) were pediatric. Of the pediatric activations, 17,140 (98.1%) were initiated through 9-1-1 and 9,487 (55.4%) resulted in transport by the documenting agency. The national data included 36,288,405 EMS activations of which 2,152,849 (5.9%) were pediatric. Of the pediatric activations 1,704,141 (79.2%) were initiated through 9-1-1 and 1,055,504 (61.9%) were transported by the documenting agency. Age and gender distributions were similar between the two groups, but the PECARN-specific data under-represents Black and Latinx patients. Comparison of EMS provider primary impressions revealed that three of the five most common were similar with injury being the most prevalent for both data sets along with mental/behavioral health and seizure. Conclusion: We demonstrated that NEMSIS can be leveraged to create network specific data sets. PECARN's EMS data were similar to the national data, though racial/ethnic minorities and some primary impressions may be under-represented. Additionally, more EMS activations in PECARN study areas originated through 9-1-1 but fewer were transported by the documenting agency. This is likely related to the type of participating agencies, their ALS response level, and the diversity of the communities they serve.

AB Wireless communication refers to long-distance transmission communication between multiple nodes without propagation through conductors or cables, and wireless communication can be carried out by radio and electromagnetic waves, etc. Judging from the current situation, the home space positioning design of the medical and elderly care communities is not perfect, which affects the traditional home care. Wireless communication can give wisdom, coordination, and development space in the smart elderly care space positioning design, allowing the elderly to interact, contact, and know their precise location and behavior. This article mainly studies the design and implementation of smart pension space positioning under BIM technology. This paper introduces the frontier of Internet-of-things technology and the theory of sensor network topology control. It uses basic IoT technology to implement the "point, line, and surface" combination of personnel placement algorithms, sensor network communication protocols, topology checks, security models, sensor network wireless communication units, and wireless communication technology. The basic technology and communication technology of personnel deployment based on BIM technology are introduced, the development strategy of wireless communications node is studied, the installation of equipment radio personnel and communication equipment is designed, and the system management platform for the design and development of staff placement in pension institutions is provided. The Web site's information service management, standardized procedures, optimized services, provision of information, intelligent management, and pension services. The experimental results of this paper show that the smart pension space positioning under the BIM technology solves the management loopholes in nursing homes, shortage of nursing staff, inefficiency, lack of services, and family conflicts. It improves the efficiency of the elderly by 25% and the safety index by 23-27%. The development of wireless communication technology promotes the development of intelligent pension space. It will be an important future development direction for the smart community pension.

AB Background: Aging-related comorbidities predispose older adults to polypharmacy and consequently an increased risk of adverse drug reactions and poor compliance. Pharmacists' interventions can have a beneficial impact on the improvement of clinical outcomes. Thus, this work aimed to assess the acceptance of Portuguese home-dwelling older adults regarding a pharmaceutical service paid by patients for medication management and pharmacotherapy follow-up. We also intended to analyze medication, characterize the medication consumption profile, and identify the main difficulties of our sample during their daily medication management. Methods: A questionnaire on adherence and medication therapy management was applied to polymedicated patients >= 65 years old, in a community pharmacy. Results: Of the 88 participants, 92.2% would be willing to pay for a pharmacotherapy management service, and 75.6% answered that they would be willing to pay for an individual medication preparation service. In addition, 45.7% of the participants were categorized as lower adherents to a medication therapeutic regimen. Our sample reported that during their daily lives, they felt difficulty: to remember to take their pills (17%), to manage so many medicines (15.9%), and to swallow the pills (9.1%). Conclusions: Polymedicated older adults are willing to pay for a service to improve the management of their medicines, suggesting that they recognize the role of pharmacists in medication management. This study provides useful information for the conceptualization of a pharmacotherapy management service that includes medication review and a pharmacotherapy follow-up.

AB Background Family caregivers are key actors in the ageing society. They are mediators between practitioners and patients and usually provide also essential daily services for the elders. However, till now, few services have been deployed to help caregivers in their care tasks as in improving their mental health which can experience sever burden due to caregiving duties. The purpose of the study is to implement a community-based participatory research project to co-design an innovative organizational model of social services for family caregivers of elderly health consumers living in remote rural areas in Italy. Methods This is a community-based participatory research project in the remote area of Vallecamonica involving four main phases. These included a quantitative analysis of caregiver needs, a scoping review on existing services for caregivers, co-design workshops with local stakeholders and caregivers to create a novel service the piloting and a first implementation of the service and the assessment of project transferability to other contexts. Results As the hours dedicated to elder care increases, both objective and developmental caregiver's burden significantly increases. Conversely, higher levels of engagement were associated with lower physical and emotional burden, and caregiver engagement was positively correlated with their perceived self-efficacy in managing disruptive patient behaviours. Based on these preliminary results, four co-design workshops with caregivers were conducted and led to the definition of the SOS caregivers service, built on four pillars structured upon the previous need analysis: a citizens' management board, training courses, peer-to-peer meetings, and project and service information. We found that co-design is an effective means of creating new services for family caregivers, whose experiential knowledge proved to be a key resource for the project team in delivering and managing services. Less positively, the transferability analysis indicated that local municipalities remain reluctant to acknowledge caregivers' pivotal role. Conclusions A dedicated support service for caregivers can ameliorate caregiving conditions and engagement levels. The service has resulted a successful co-productive initiative for a psycho-social intervention for family caregivers. For the future, we suggest that family caregiver should be considered an active partner in the process of designing novel psycho-social services and not just as recipients to enhance a better aging-in-place process.

TI Application of a Computerized Decision Support System to Develop Care
   Strategies for Elderly Hemodialysis Patients
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID LIFE
AB In this paper, the strategy of elderly haemodialysis patients' care is analysed by the computer's decision system to conduct an in-depth research machine. Maintenance haemodialysis patients have a high demand for continuation care, and healthcare workers should provide personalized and specialized seamless continuation care services for patients according to patients' needs, by reasonably using the hospital, community, and other health resources and with the help of emerging network technologies, such as information platforms and wearable devices to prolong the survival period of patients and improve their self-management ability and quality of life. The service provision and compensation strategy of the combined healthcare model should be optimized to improve the health protection of the elderly and promote health equity. On the one hand, it should target strengthening the service provision of healthcare integration, guide the elderly to reasonably choose the healthcare integration model, and pay attention to the spiritual and cultural needs and end-of-life care services for the elderly. On the other hand, we should expand the financing channels of medical insurance, optimize the design of compensation mechanisms, explore the role of health risk sharing, and accelerate the development of long-term care insurance, independent of basic medical insurance. The reliability of the scale was found to be 0.916 for the total Cronbach alpha coefficient, 0.798-0.919 for each dimension, and 0.813 for the fold-half reliability of the scale; the validity indicated that the correlation coefficient range of each article day with the total scale score was 0.27-0.72, and the correlation coefficient range of each dimension with the total scale was 0.56-0.72. The validation factor analysis was used to verify the structure of the scale. The validation factor analysis indexes met the fitting criteria after correction. The model fitted better with the actual model after correction, indicating that the scale has good reliability.

AB Medication use is an important risk factor for falls. Community pharmacists should therefore organise fall prevention care; however, little is known about patients' expectations of such services. This qualitative study aims to explore the expectations of community-dwelling older patients regarding fall prevention services provided by community pharmacies. Telephone intakes, followed by three focus groups, were conducted with 17 patients, who were aged >= 75 years, used at least one fall risk-increasing drug (FRID) and were registered at a community pharmacy in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Some time of the focus groups was spent on playing a game involving knowledge questions and activities to stimulate discussion of topics related to falling. Data were collected between January 2020 and April 2020, and all focus groups were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. The precaution adoption process model (PAPM) was applied during data analysis. Patients who had already experienced a fall more often mentioned that they took precautions to prevent falling. In general, patients were unaware that their medication use could increase their fall risk. Therefore, they did not expect pharmacists to play a role in fall prevention. However, many patients were interested in deprescribing. Patients also wanted to be informed about which medication could increase fall risk. In conclusion, although patients initially did not see a role for pharmacists in fall prevention, their perception changed when they were informed about the potential fall risk-increasing effects of some medications. Patients expected pharmacists to focus on drug-related interventions to reduce fall risk, such as deprescribing.

AB Background In response to the increasing burden of cancer in Tanzania, the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children launched National Cancer Treatment Guidelines (TNCTG) in February 2020. The guidelines aimed to improve and standardize oncology care in the country. At Ocean Road Cancer Institute (ORCI), we developed a theory-informed implementation strategy to promote guideline-concordant care. As part of the situation analysis for implementation strategy development, we conducted focus group discussions to evaluate clinical systems and contextual factors that influence guideline-based practice prior to the launch of the TNCTG.
   Materials and Methods In June 2019, three focus group discussions were conducted with a total of 21 oncology clinicians at ORCI, stratified by profession. A discussion guide was used to stimulate dialogue about facilitators and barriers to delivery of guideline-concordant care. Discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, translated, and analyzed using thematic framework analysis.
   Results Participants identified factors both within the inner context of ORCI clinical systems and outside of ORCI. Themes within the clinical systems included capacity and infrastructure, information technology, communication, efficiency, and quality of services provided. Contextual factors external to ORCI included interinstitutional coordination, oncology capacity in peripheral hospitals, public awareness and beliefs, and financial barriers. Participants provided pragmatic suggestions for strengthening cancer care delivery in Tanzania.
   Conclusion Our results highlight several barriers and facilitators within and outside of the clinical systems at ORCI that may affect uptake of the TNCTG. Our findings were used to inform a broader guideline implementation strategy, in an effort to improve uptake of the TNCTGs at ORCI.
   Implications for Practice This study provides an assessment of cancer care delivery systems in a low resource setting from the unique perspectives of local multidisciplinary oncology clinicians. Situational analysis of contextual factors that are likely to influence guideline implementation outcomes is the first step of developing an implementation strategy for cancer treatment guidelines. Many of the barriers identified in this study represent actionable targets that will inform the next phases of our implementation strategy for guideline-concordant cancer care in Tanzania and comparable settings.

AB IMPORTANCE Literature on peer-to-peer (P2P) programs suggests they improve health and wellbeing of older adults. Analysis from a previous study showed P2P to be associated with higher rates of hospitalization and no significant differences in rates of emergency department or urgent care visits; however, it is not known whether measures of health and well-being varied by group over time.
   OBJECTIVE To compare the association between receiving P2P support and secondary outcomes (ie, health status, quality of life, and depressive and anxiety symptoms) with receiving standard community services (SCS) over time.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study was conducted among a volunteer sample of older adults (>= 65 years) who were new to P2P or were already receiving P2P and a corresponding control group. Participants were matched between groups on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The study was conducted from March 2015 to December 2017 at 3 community-based organizations that delivered P2P in California, Florida, and New York. Data analysis was performed from October 2018 through May 2020.
   EXPOSURES P2P support, provided by trained older adult volunteers.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mental and physical components of the health status and quality of life measure and depressive and anxiety symptoms were collected over 12 months. The hypothesis was that older adults receiving P2P support would maintain higher health status and quality of life than the SCS group.
   RESULTS A total of 503 participants were screened, 456 participants were enrolled and had baseline data, and 8 participants only had baseline information with no follow-up data, leaving 448 participants (231 [52%] in the SCS group; 217 [48%] in the P2P group; 363 [81%] women; mean [SD] age, 80 [9] years). The P2P group had improvements in mental health (change at 12 months, 1.1 points; 95% CI, -0.8 to 3.0 points) and physical health (change at 12 months, 1.0 points; 95% CI, -0.7 to 2.8 points). However, the difference of differences between the 2 groups did not differ significantly from baseline to 12 months (mental health: 0.2 points; 95% CI -2.3 to 2.7 points; physical health: 1.7 points; 95% CI, -0.6 to 3.9 points). The P2P and SCS groups had a statistically significant difference of differences in anxiety symptoms of 0.36 points (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.61 points). There were no significant differences in depressive symptoms or mental and physical components of the health status and quality of life.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that receiving P2P support did not slow the decline of health and well-being in older adults compared with those who received SCS. Baseline imbalance in key characteristics, even after adjusting for the imbalance using the propensity score method, may explain the results. Randomized trials are needed.

AB Consumer-directed care (CDC) programmes, in principle, provide consumers with choices around who provides care services to them, what services and when. However, literature around consumer behaviour of older adults, especially concerning the factors that may support home care choices, is sparse. The purpose of this study was to understand the decision-making processes and spending preferences of community-dwelling seniors assessed eligible for CDC home care services. We completed an explorative inquiry using a "think-aloud" technique with eligible consumers in South Australia. The inquiry had two components. First, consumers used imitation money to simulate the purchase of home care supports while talking out loud their decision-making processes. Then, semi-structured interviews were completed to identify underlying thoughts that informed the decisions made and spending preferences. Fifteen consumers, mean age 82 years (range 70-94), participated. The most frequently prioritised choice was domestic assistance. However, choices were made based on a perceived hierarchy of need (due to limits placed on available budgets for care). Interview data revealed that the decision making and service preferences were also based on limited knowledge about what was available. Consumers revealed perceived value in purchasing expert advice to guide their choices and preference for relational not transactional service delivery.

AB To explore relatives', community nurses' and general practitioners' perspectives and experiences in promot-ing Personal Safety Alerting Device (PSAD) use among community-dwelling older adults, we applied a quali-tative study design. Altogether 15 focus groups and 11 semi-structured interviews were conducted. Data -analysis followed the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven. PSAD use was considered to be complex. Relatives and health care professionals are involved in a negotiation process comprising three phases: A) waiting for a critical event in the older adult's everyday life; B) introducing the idea of a PSAD; C) deciding on and support -ing PSAD use. In conclusion, the actors involved in PSAD use should be aware of the negotiation process, which is complex, dynamic, iterative and needs time. While nurses play a crucial role, they lack sufficient knowledge for comprehensive PSAD counselling. The negotiation process could serve as an example for other technologies in the context of aging in place. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Medication management in residential aged care facilities is an ongoing concern. Numerous studies have reported high rates of inappropriate prescribing and medication use in aged care facilities, which contribute to residents' adverse health outcomes. There is a need for new models of care that enhance inter-disciplinary collaboration between residential aged care facility staff and healthcare professionals, to improve medication management. Pilot research has demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of integrating a pharmacist into the aged care facility team to improve the quality use of medicines. This protocol describes the design and methods for a cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the outcomes and conduct economic evaluation of a service model where on-site pharmacists are integrated into residential aged care facility healthcare teams to improve medication management.
   Methods: Intervention aged care facilities will employ on-site pharmacists to work as part of their healthcare teams 2 to 2.5 days per week for 12 months. On-site pharmacists, in collaboration with facility nurses, prescribers, community pharmacists, residents and families will conduct medication management activities to improve the quality use of medicines. Aged care facilities in the control group will continue usual care. The target sample size is 1188 residents from a minimum of 13 aged care facilities. The primary outcome is the appropriateness of prescribing, measured by the proportion of residents who are prescribed at least one potentially inappropriate medicine according to the 2019 Beers Criteria. Secondary outcomes include hospital and emergency department presentations, fall rates, prevalence and dose of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Score, staff influenza vaccination rate, time spent on medication rounds, appropriateness of dose form modification and completeness of resident's allergy and adverse drug reaction documentation. A cost-consequence and cost-effectiveness analysis will be embedded in the trial.
   Discussion: The results of this study will provide information on clinical and economic outcomes of a model that integrates on-site pharmacists into Australian residential aged care facilities. The results will provide policymakers with recommendations relevant to further implementation of this model.

AB BackgroundThis study tried to improve the operational efficiency and service quality of the community case management model for the High-Care Elderly in Communities in Taiwan. This study tried to assistant social workers in community care sites to establish individualized treatment planning, to empower them with flexibility to discover and utilize their own unique strengths, to reach the goal of developing community care capacity.MethodsA case consulting model was employed in this study by providing case by case supervision service. We collected all supervision meeting records and related data as our qualitative research materials, analyzed these materials and tried to define intervention effectiveness of the individualized supervision strategy under the strength perspective applied to the case management model of the high-care elderly in communities. To find out what helps these social workers the most, and how these social workers realize and recognize their process and key to improve their service quality and work efficiency, in the way of qualitative interpretation.ResultsA supervision model under the perspective of strength was developed in this study, and was applied to clinical community care sites to help their social workers. The results proved that our supervision model provided an opportunity to empower and re-know themselves, re-establish their professional confidence and meaning of existence for their organization, and eventually produced positive effect to quality of service and service receiver's satisfaction improvement. The key feature that made this supervision model of the strength perspective work was to let social workers have the autonomy to interpret the challenges they face and to think possible alternative solutions creatively.ConclusionsThis study showed that create a supervisee-friendly psycho-socio environment empowered these workers by increasing their resource network and taking advantage of what they still have and what they were good at, this could help these workers upgrade their level on ladders of empowerment, become an active and independent professional worker that have power and confidence to make treatment and intervention.

AB Local governments and scholars in China have recently proposed and developed community-based comprehensive service facilities for older adults in response to population aging and greater service needs of older adults in urban areas. This study proposes a method to identify the ideal distribution of such facilities by combining the nested ecological model of aging in place as the theoretical foundation with a geographic information system as the methodological tool. The findings indicate that many essential services, particularly health care and places for socialization, are lacking in urban areas when walkability and accessibility to public services are considered. The findings also indicate that the downtown and main factory areas with higher population density have a higher need for developing community-based comprehensive services facilities for older adults. The proposed method shows strong potential for locating service networks and provides useful information for policy development, urban planning, and architectural programming.

AB Introduction
   Process evaluations examining programme implementation are often conducted in conjunction with effectiveness studies. Their inclusion in studies with Aboriginal participants can give an understanding of programme delivery in Aboriginal community contexts. The Ironbark: Standing Strong and Tall programme was codesigned with Aboriginal communities and includes exercise and facilitated 'yarning' discussion about fall risk and prevention strategies. The programme pilot showed favourable outcomes and acceptability for Aboriginal people aged 45 years and over. The Ironbark: Standing Strong and Tall programme is now being compared with a 'Healthy Community' programme in a cluster randomised controlled trial within Aboriginal health and community services. An embedded process evaluation aims to explore relationships between participation and programme outcomes and the quality of programme implementation.
   Methods and analysis
   The process evaluation will use a mixed methods design, guided by Indigenous research methodology. It will evaluate quantitative data (number of completed sessions, site coaching checklist tool, participant and facilitator questionnaire data and a participant habit formation scale), as well as qualitative data (open-ended responses from project and site staff and semistructured interviews using yarning with study participants and site managers). A programme logic model was developed to explain the intended inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes, which guided this process evaluation design.
   Conclusion
   This process evaluation of a fall prevention programme for older Aboriginal people using a mixed methods design and data triangulation will allow for a comprehensive understanding of study findings. Multiple study sites allow for generalisability of findings and exploration of variation across sites.

AB Aims: To evaluate a training program that supports community-based service staff in implementing aging-inplace and end-of-life care programs. Background: Globally, as the population ages, the need for end-of-life care has never been greater. Since Japan is facing the issues of a super-aged population sooner than most countries, there is a particularly urgent need to enhance end-of-life care for older people. Most Japan's older people wish to spend their final days at home, however, only 11-13% end their lives at home, while 73% die in hospitals. As part of care system, small-scale community-based service for aging-in-place established across Japan in 2006 managed locally. These are flexible services using home or facility care or both for the individual to live long term at their preferred place. We developed the end-of-life care educational training program to encourage behavioral changes in communitybased service staff of various readiness levels. Design: Mixed methods study design. Methods: A pre-post evaluation of knowledge, confidence and attitude toward end-of-life care, combining quantitative and qualitative data from 53 community-based service staff members who participated in the training program from September 2017 to September 2019. Participants were informed of the end-of-life care process using focus group discussions about end-of-life care and completed surveys evaluating the program before, immediately following and three months after the training. We used the four-level Kirkpatrick model as the evaluation indicator. Results: Quantitative analysis results indicated that participants were satisfied with the training program. Their knowledge scores regarding end-of-life care significantly improved; they also experienced confidence gains and changes in attitudes, becoming more approving of end-of-life care. Qualitative data revealed details of participants' satisfaction and what was learned. Through the focus group discussions, they created action plans for implementing end-of-life care programs, which some had accomplished in their local centers by the three-month follow-up. Conclusions: These results suggest that the training program is effective for promoting end-of-life care through community-based services in Japan. Conducting follow-up training could effectively strengthen participants' commitment to end-of-life care at community-based services. Use of the training program is expected to promote services to support aging-in-place.

AB Background Healthcare accessibility, a key public health issue, includes potential (spatial accessibility) and realized access (healthcare utilization) dimensions. Moreover, the assessment of healthcare service potential access and utilization should take into account the care provided by primary and secondary services. Previous studies on the relationship between healthcare spatial accessibility and utilization often used conventional statistical methods without addressing the scale effect and spatial processes. This study investigated the impact of spatial accessibility to primary and secondary healthcare services on length of hospital stay (LOS), and the efficiency of using a geospatial approach to model this relationship. Methods This study focused on the >= 75-year-old population of the Nord administrative region of France. Inpatient hospital spatial accessibility was computed with the E2SFCA method, and then the LOS was calculated from the French national hospital activity and patient discharge database. Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial autoregressive (SAR), and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to analyse the relationship between LOS and spatial accessibility to inpatient hospital care and to three primary care service types (general practitioners, physiotherapists, and home-visiting nurses). Each model performance was assessed with measures of goodness of fit. Spatial statistical methods to reduce or eliminate spatial autocorrelation in the residuals were also explored. Results GWR performed best (highest R-2 and lowest Akaike information criterion). Depending on global model (OLS and SAR), LOS was negatively associated with spatial accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. GWR highlighted local patterns of spatial variation in LOS estimates. The distribution of areas in which LOS was positively or negatively associated with spatial accessibility varied when considering accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. Conclusions Our findings suggest that spatial regressions could be useful for analysing the relationship between healthcare spatial accessibility and utilization. In our case study, hospitalization of elderly people was shorter in areas with better accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. This may be related to the presence of effective community healthcare services. GWR performed better than LOS and SAR. The identification by GWR of how these relationships vary spatially could bring important information for public healthcare policies, hospital decision-making, and healthcare resource allocation.

DE Area Agencies on Aging; home; and community-based care and services;

ID ADULTS
AB The National Aging Network serves millions of older Americans seeking home- and community-based services, but places others on waitlists due to limited resources. Little is known about how states determine service delivery and waitlists. We therefore conducted a process evaluation and analyzed data from one five-county Area Agency on Aging in Florida, where an algorithm calculates clients' priority scores for service delivery. From 23,225 screenings over 5.5 years, clients with higher priority scores were older, married, living with caregivers, and had more health problems and needs for assistance. Approximately 51% received services (e.g., meals/nutrition, case management, caregiver support), 11% were eligible/being enrolled, and 38% remained on waitlists. Service status was complex due to multiple service enrollments and terminations, funding priorities, and transfers to third-party providers. More research is needed regarding how other states determine eligibility and deliver services, potentially informing national standards that promote optimal health in older Americans.

TI Fitness to drive practices among non-driver trained occupational

AB Introduction Driving is a valued occupation given the independence and freedom it provides. Safe driving performance can be impacted by medical conditions, change in functional status and ageing processes. Occupational therapy driver assessors (OTDAs) provide invaluable driving recommendations; however, this requires specialist training for the therapist and is costly for clients. The number of OTDAs is not expected to meet the growing demand for expert services in this area, and little is known about the practices that non- OTDAs use to assist clients with returning to driving. The aims of this study were to investigate the practices of non-OTDAs in a community-based rehabilitation setting in Australia with respect to knowledge, confidence and skills in assessments, recommendations and outcomes for clients as part of the return to driving process.
   Methods A descriptive study including medical record audits between April and September 2019 and staff surveys were completed at a large metropolitan community-based rehabilitation facility. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used to summarise data.
   Results A total of 102 client medical records were audited, and 13 clinician surveys were completed. Medical record audits identified that return to driving was not consistently addressed by occupational therapists. Clinician surveys outlined a lack of knowledge and confidence of return to driving processes and available assessment tools to guide this process.
   Conclusion All occupational therapists have an ethical obligation to address driving as an activity of daily living; however, non-OTDAs report that they are not equipped for this role. This may negatively impact on driver safety, independence and overall health and well-being of clients in community-based rehabilitation. Further research is indicated to develop evidence-based driving resources to support best practice of non-OTDAs.

AB Objectives: To demonstrate the usefulness of primary data collection using clinician-rated and self-rated standardized measures to describe adult day program (ADP) populations and address programming issues such as identifying members at risk of dropping out.
   Setting and Participants: One ADP in London, Ontario, and 2 ADPs in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. A total of 223 community-dwelling older adults were recruited across the 3 different programs.
   Methods: The interRAI Community Health or Home Care Assessment and self-rated psychosocial assessments were collected on program enrollment. Data analyses included descriptive statistics, comparison of the populations between ADPs, and multinomial regression models to assess reasons for program withdrawal.
   Results: Mean ages across the 3 programs ranged from 78.3 to 83.8 years and the proportion of women ranged from 49.3% to 56.6%. Compared with one of the ADPs, members from 2 other ADPs exhibited higher use of mobility aids (P < .001), higher levels of cognitive impairment (P < .05), increased risk for institutionalization (P < .001), lower levels of depression (P < .01), and greater need for supervision for basic and instrumental activities of daily living (P < .01). Members assessed to be at higher risk for institutionalization and have increased medical complexity showed possible association with program withdrawal at one ADP.
   Conclusions and Implications: The tools were useful in identifying differences in physical and psychosocial characteristics of members across the 3 ADPs. Information collected from interRAI and self-rated psychosocial assessments may be helpful in the development of individualized care plans, program services, and recommendations that target transitional care. By understanding member profiles and reasons for withdrawal, ADPs may be able to develop strategies to help members stay in the program and live in the community longer.

AB Purpose Under the impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this paper contributes in the deployment of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)-based system, namely AIoT-based Domestic Care Service Matching System (AIDCS), to the existing electronic health (eHealth) system so as to enhance the delivery of elderly-oriented domestic care services. Design/methodology/approach The proposed AIDCS integrates IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to (1) capture real-time health data of the elderly at home and (2) provide the knowledge support for decision making in the domestic care appointment service in the community. Findings A case study was conducted in a local domestic care centre which provided elderly oriented healthcare services to the elderly. By integrating IoT and AI into the service matching process of the mobile apps platform provided by the local domestic care centre, the results proved that customer satisfaction and the quality of the service delivery were improved by observing the key performance indicators of the transactions after the implementation of the AIDCS. Originality/value Following the outbreak of COVID-19, this is a new attempt to overcome the limited research done on the integration of IoT and AI techniques in the domestic care service. This study not only inherits the ability of the existing eHealth system to automatically capture and monitor the health status of the elderly in real-time but also improves the overall quality of domestic care services in term of responsiveness, effectiveness and efficiency.

AB Purpose China is experiencing tremendous changes of rapid urbanization and aging society. The development of age-friendly communities (AFCs) has been encouraged for improving health and well-being of older adults. Hence, this study aimed to deepen the understanding of AFCs in China and to investigate the integrated relationships between AFCs and the quality of life (QoL) of older adults, using a large-scale questionnaire survey. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted in Hefei, China, to investigate the complicated relationships between the components of AFCs and the QoL of older adults. Ultimately, 1,383 valid questionnaires were collected from senior respondents aged more than 60 years. Several statistical methods, including reliability analysis, correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM), were adopted to develop an integrated model for AFC components and the QoL of older adults. Findings Six AFC components and four older adults' QoL factors were identified. The SEM results revealed integrated relationships between specific AFC components and the QoL of older adults: (1) physical QoL was affected by outdoor spaces, public transportation, housing and community and health services; (2) psychological QoL was predicted by most of the AFC components except community and health services; and (3) environmental QoL and social QoL were both influenced by outdoor spaces, communication and information and community and health services. Practical implications In order to enhance the QoL of older adults, it is suggested that outdoor spaces need to be enlarged by fully using the facilities and playgrounds of middle schools and renovating the older buildings. The locations of public transportation stations are recommended to be revised to be within a 5-minute walking distance of senior residents. Improvements to the social environment of AFCs, by increasing the coverage of medical services and creating multiple approaches to recreational activities, are encouraged. Originality/value These findings have empirical significance for urban planners and policy-makers in regard to identifying major components of AFCs and understanding the effect of those components on the QoL of older adults.

AB Aim: To investigate the needed, unneeded and unmet health care services among rural community-dwelling older adults in China and examine the influencing factors, aiming to facilitate the global development of the home care system for a healthier world.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study investigated rural areas in three provinces in Western China. A total of 1727 rural community-dwelling older adults were enrolled. The needed, unneeded and unmet health care services were assessed by the Supply and Demand of Health Care Services (SD-HCS) questionnaire for older adults.
   Results: Respect (73%, 1265/1727) was the most needed. The other top 9 needed mainly belonged to the divisions of health monitoring and information regarding chronic diseases. Re-employment or part-time jobs (71%, 1230/ 1727) was the most unneeded. All five protection and safety items were the most unmet but needed. Religion was the main influencing factor of those health care services that were less unmet but needed.
   Conclusions: Respect was basic for older adults, and chronic disease management was in great demand among rural community-dwelling older adults. Due to low willingness and the crisis workforce, a more flexi-ble retirement policy is needed in rural China. It is urgent to improve the emergency care system in rural areas. Last but not least, more research is needed to explore the association between religion and health.

AB The incidence of chronic diseases among elderly patients increases annually with the accelerating aging process in China. Complications arising from the progression of these diseases may affect the ability of the aged to communicate and make decisions about future medical and personal care. This study aimed to investigate acceptance and influencing factors of advance care planning for community-dwelling elderly patients with chronic diseases in the Republic of China. Using a convergent parallel mixed-methods design, 471 elderly Chinese nationals older than 60 years with chronic diseases were recruited using convenience sampling. Quantitative data collection used Chinese versions of the Elderly Death Attitude Scale, Modified Barthel Index Rating Scale, and the Advance Care Planning Acceptance Questionnaire, followed by 14 patients drawn from the quantitative phase. Interviews were thematically analyzed. The results showed that attitude to death and quality of life were key predictors of advance care planning implementation preference, whereas family support and past medical experience were significant factors. The study highlighted the importance of conducting regular education about death, paying attention to quality of life, providing family support, and discussing past medical experience in order to implement advance care planning for elderly patients with chronic diseases in China.

AB Background: The ongoing changes in population demographics increase the relevance of dignified aging across Europe. Community-based health care (CBHC) organizations are necessary to provide sustainable strategies for organizing care for older persons in need of support. To support the digitalization of these organizations, new business models and suitable web platforms are necessary.
   Objective: This study, which is part of the European Active and Assisted Living (AAL) project called "ICareCoops", aimed to explore concepts, approaches, and workflows of CBHC organizations to achieve a comprehensive understanding of extant services offered and relevant requirements to support these services with information and computer technology (ICT) solutions.
   Methods: A qualitative study with six focus groups (FGs) with 40 participants was conducted in Switzerland and Slovenia to identify potential stakeholders' needs and requirements for the user-centered development of a web platform. Data were collected from three different stakeholder groups: (1) older persons in need of support as care receivers, (2) significant others of older persons in need of support, and (3) managers or care providers of CBHC organizations. A semistructured interview guide with open questions was used for data collection. FG sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the content of the FG sessions. To assist with further web platform development, the responses of the FG participants were translated into user stories to describe technical requirements.
   Results: By analyzing the transcripts, five main categories were identified: (1) ICT usage behavior of users, (2) challenges of web platform usage, (3) content and technical requirements for the web platform, (4) form and services of CBHC organizations, and (5) rationales of CBHC organizations. The main issues identified were the need for seniors to have individual contact with the CBHC organization and the possibility to coordinate routine services via the web platform, such as ordering meals-on-wheels or booking a caregiver to accompany an older person to the doctor.
   Conclusions: The majority of participants showed a lack of familiarity with the usage of ICT. Nevertheless, they were open-minded regarding web platform usage to facilitate workflows and to benefit CBHC organizations. Cooperatives as an organizational model demonstrate a high potential to address users' needs. Therefore, the web platform offers an essential tool for innovative health care models in the future. Searching for care services, contacting care providers, and communicating with care providers was preferred via personal contact and seemed to be the key element for user acceptance and for the successful implementation of a web platform like "ICareCoops" to support CBHC organizations.

AB Objective To assess whether nutritional screening and intervention improve the nutritional status of older adults living in the community.
   Methods The Kiama MOW service performed nutrition screening, after being trained by the research team and maintained the dataset. De-identified data was provided to the research team for analysis. MOW staff also kept detailed notes during the nutrition screening process and in discussions with clients. These notes were provided to the research team along with the de-identified quantitative data, a summary of the measures taken following screening, interventions that were recommended to clients by MOW staff. Staff were not formally interviewed about their experiences in conducting nutrition screening but their open-ended text comments were retrospectively summarised, as well as anecdotal comments made to the researcher (AH) that was involved in training and supporting the MOW team during the intervention period.
   Results Forty-two individuals (25 women, mean age = 79.8 +/- 8.9 years) were referred (21 well-nourished, 17 at risk of malnutrition and 4 malnourished). After reassessment (n = 21), nutritional status had significantly improved (P = .008 for all referrals and P < .001 for those at risk of malnutrition or malnourished). The main interventions provided were as follows: nutrition education (100%), home-delivered meals (78%) and social outings including meals (17%).
   Conclusions The My Aged Care portal may be a feasible source of referral of this population to perform routine nutrition screening for appropriate intervention.

AB Background People prefer to age in place and not move into a nursing home as long as possible. The prevention of cognitive and functional impairments is feasible to support this goal. Health services play a key role in providing support for underlying medical conditions. We examined differentials in nursing home admissions between patient sharing networks in Germany and whether potential variations can be attributed to indicators of health care provision. Methods We conducted an ecological study using data of patients of 65 years and above from all 11 AOK statutory health insurance companies in Germany. Nursing home admissions were observed in a cohort of persons becoming initially care-dependent in 2006 (n = 118,213) with a follow-up of up to 10 years. A patient sharing network was constructed and indicators for quality of health care were calculated based on data of up to 6.6 million patients per year. Community detection was applied to gain distinct patient populations. Analyses were conducted descriptively and through regression analyses to identify the variation explained by included quality indicators. Results The difference in the proportion of nursing home admissions between identified clusters shows an interquartile range (IQR) of 12.6% and the average time between onset of care-dependency and admission to a nursing home an IQR of 10,4 quarters. Included quality indicators attributed for 40% of these variations for the proportion of nursing home admissions and 49% for the time until nursing home admission, respectively. Indicators of process quality showed the single highest contribution. Effects of single indicators were inconclusive. Conclusions Health services can support persons in their preference to age in place. Research and discussion on adequate health care for care-dependent persons and on conditions, where nursing home admission may be beneficial, is necessary.

AB Aims: To develop a model illustrating the factors that can influence care needs in daily living (CNDL) of older adults and the pathways between these.
   Background: The care needs in community-dwelling older adults have increased sharply. A better understanding of the elderly's CNDL would thus help policymakers define which types of support and services should be given.
   Methods: A multicentre study with structural equation modelling was conducted in this study. We recruited 3,448 community-dwelling older adults in China by using a stratified random cluster sampling technique.
   Results: Physical and mental health was the strongest predictor of CNDL. Both age and living situation had positive effects on CNDL, while economic factors, social support and family support were the major risk factors for CNDL.
   Conclusion: The presented model provides a better understanding of how to address CNDL in the targeted population. The older adults who are the oldest, low-income, non-empty nesters, and with poor self-rated health or the signs of loneliness should be firstly targeted for daily assistance.
   Implications for Nursing Management: Using this model could provide health authorities and managers with the information of distinguishing between the priority group and the strategies for easing the caregiving burden in older adults care, and thus improving resource utilization.

DE successful aging; aging in place; home safety; occupational therapy;
   home and community based care and services; grounded theory
AB Current literature on aging in place highlights the socioemotional components that act as barriers to remaining in the home, but it often neglects actionable safety features of the home which may also pose a threat. Furthermore, this literature often neglects self-reported barriers to aging in place. Utilizing grounded theory, a retrospective review of home safety assessments completed in Philadelphia analyzed older adult reports to determine what factors older adults view as barriers to their aging in place plans. Overarching categories that were discovered through the data analysis process included barriers related to home mobility and safety, personal health, access to community services, home improvement and maintenance needs, general safety concerns, and bathroom safety. Results indicate that older adults can identify many barriers to aging within their home, but that accessing support and services to overcome these barriers requires additional resources and funding.

AB Introduction: With a rapidly aging population, the Malaysian health care system needs to develop solutions to address the lack of resources that are required for the assessment of the older person. The complex nature of geriatric syndromes coupled with the occurrence of multiple comorbid illnesses with aging, make geriatric assessment a resource intensive process. Digital health solutions could play an important role in supporting existing health care systems, especially in low and middle income countries, with limited speciality services in geriatrics.
   Objective: This is a pilot study aimed at screening for geriatric syndromes through self-administered online surveys in urban community dwelling older Malaysians and assessing the pattern of geriatric syndromes in relation to the frailty status of the study participants.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional pilot study conducted between July-September 2020. Community dwelling adults aged 60 years and over were invited to take part in an online survey. Information on sociodemographic variables, comorbidities, and the self-reported results of geriatric syndromes (frailty, sarcopenia, anorexia of aging, urinary incontinence, falls, and cognitive impairment), were collected through the survey.
   Results: Data was collected for 162 participants over a period of 2 months. The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 66.42 (5.25) years with 64.9% females. Majority of the respondents were of Chinese ethnic origin (67.9%) and had tertiary level of education (75.9%). The average time taken by participants to complete the survey was 16.86 min. Urinary incontinence was the highest reported geriatric syndrome (55.1%) followed by falls (37.6%), anorexia of aging (32.8%), cognitive impairment (27.8%), and sarcopenia (8.3%). Frailty was detected in 4.5% of the study population. Loss of weight in the previous year was the highest reported component of the frailty assessment tool. The presence of sarcopenia, anorexia of aging, poor/fair self-rated health, urinary incontinence, and multimorbidity were significantly higher in older adults who were frail or prefrail.
   Conclusion: Screening for geriatric syndromes through online surveys is a feasible approach to identify older adults in the community who are likely to benefit from geriatric assessment. However, the demographic profile of the older population that are accessible through such digital platforms is limited.

AB BackgroundEvidence is scarce on how to promote health and decrease cumulative inequalities for disadvantaged older people. Downstream complex interventions focusing on intermediate factors (self-management, health literacy and social capital) may have the potential to mitigate the inequitable impacts of social determinants in health. The aim of the AEQUALIS study was to assess the effectiveness of a group-based intervention to improve self-perceived health as indicator of health inequality.MethodsPragmatic randomised clinical trial addressed to older adults (>= 60years) living in urban disadvantaged areas with low self-perceived health. The intervention was delivered in primary care settings and community assets between 2015 and 2017 and consisted in 12 weekly sessions. The primary outcome was self-perceived health assessed in two ways: with the first item of the SF-12 questionnaire, and with the EQ-5D visual analog scale. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, social capital, self-management, mental health and use of health services. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post intervention and follow-up at 9months after the end of the intervention.Results390 people were allocated to the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG) and 194 participants and 164 were included in the data analysis, respectively. Self perceived health as primary outcome assessed with SF-12-1 was not specifically affected by the intervention, but with the EQ-5D visual analog scale showed a significant increase at one-year follow-up only in the IG (MD=4.80, 95%CI [1.09, 8.52]). IG group improved health literacy in terms of a better understanding of medical information (-0.62 [-1.10, -0.13]). The mental component of SF-12 improved (3.77 [1.82, 5.73]), and depressive symptoms decreased at post-intervention (-1.26 [-1.90, -0.63]), and at follow-up (-0.95 [-1.62, -0.27]). The use of antidepressants increased in CG at the follow-up (1.59 [0.33, 2.86]), while it remained stable in the IG.ConclusionsThis study indicates that a group intervention with a strong social component, conducted in primary health care and community assets, shows promising effects on mental health and can be used as a strategy for health promotion among older adults in urban disadvantaged areas.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02733523.

AB Purpose: This study describes patient care experiences of solo-rheumatologist and co-managed care models utilizing an Advanced Clinician Practitioner in Arthritis Care-trained Extended Role Practitioner (ACPAC-ERP) in three community rheumatology practices.
   Materials and Methods: Patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) were assigned to care provided by one of three (2 senior, 1 early-career) community-based rheumatologists (usual care), or an ACPAC-ERP (co-managed care) for the 6-months following diagnosis. Patient experiences were surveyed using validated measures of patient satisfaction (Patient Doctor Interaction Scale-PDIS), global ratings of confidence and satisfaction, referral patterns, disease activity (RADAI) and self-perceived disability (HAQ-Disability) as well as demographic information. Practice capacity was evaluated 18-months prior to, and across, the study period.
   Results: Of 55 participants (mean age 56.6 years, 61.8% female), 33 received co-managed care. Most participants were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (65.5%) with a median symptom duration of 1.1 years. At 6-months, patients from both models of care were equally satisfied in terms of the information provided (usual care 4.6 vs co-managed care 4.7/5=greater satisfaction), rapport with health-care provider (4.6 vs 4.6/5) and having needs met (4.7 vs 4.5/5). Overall satisfaction was high (87.2 vs 85.3/100=completely satisfied) as was confidence in the system by which care was received (85.0 vs 82.1/100=completely confident). Usual care patients reported higher perceived disability than co-managed patients (HAQ-Disability 0.5 vs 0.2/3=unable to do). Significant differences in overall RADAI score (p=0.014) were found between the two models. The senior rheumatologist, with a previously saturated practice, attained a 37% capacity increase for new patients utilizing the co-managed care model.
   Conclusion: The ACPAC-ERP model was equivalent to the solo-rheumatologist model with regard to patient experience and satisfaction. A co-management model utilizing a highly trained ACPAC-ERP can increase capacity in community rheumatology clinics for patients newly diagnosed with IA while maintaining confidence and satisfaction with their care.

AB Objective To determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a peer mentorship intervention to improve self-management of osteoarthritis (OA). Design Six-month parallel group non-blinded randomised feasibility trial. Setting One secondary care and one primary care UK National Health Service Trust. Participants Fifty adults aged >= 55 years old with hip and/or knee OA. Interventions Participants were allocated 1:1 to the intervention or control group using an online randomisation service. Intervention group participants received usual care (information resources) and up to eight community-based self-management support sessions delivered by a peer mentor (trained volunteer with hip and/or knee OA). Control group participants received usual care only. Outcome measures Key feasibility outcomes were participant and peer mentor recruitment and attrition, intervention completion and the sample size required for a definitive RCT. Based on these feasibility outcomes, four success criteria for proceeding to a definitive RCT were prespecified. Patient-reported outcomes were collected via questionnaires at baseline, 8 weeks and 6 months. Results Ninety-six individuals were screened, 65 were eligible and 50 were randomised (25 per group). Of the 24 participants who commenced the intervention, 20 completed it. Four participants did not complete the 6-month questionnaire. Twenty-one individuals were eligible for the peer mentor role, 15 were trained and 5 withdrew prior to being matched with a participant. No intervention-related harms occurred. Allowing for 20% attrition, the sample size required for a definitive RCT was calculated as 170 participants. The intervention group showed improvements in self-management compared with the control group. Conclusions The feasibility outcomes achieved the prespecified criteria for proceeding to an RCT. The exploratory analyses suggest peer mentorship may improve OA self-management. An RCT of the OA peer mentorship intervention is therefore warranted with minor modifications to the intervention and trial procedures.

ID PRIMARY-CARE; QUALITY
AB Background: In the time since primary care was implemented in China in 2009, programs of promoting residents signing with family doctor services have been key. However, there has been a lack of effective evaluation of its implementation.
   Methods: We used mixed methods for evaluating existing measures of facilitating signing with family doctors in Shanghai. Based on the Donabedian model, qualitative informant interviews were conducted to obtain experts' evaluations in aspects of team construction (structure) and innovative solutions for promoting and supervising signings (process). Quantitative data were used to analyse the utilization situation (outcome) from "Shanghai Family Doctor Signing Data Platform".
   Results: Measures of signing with family doctors in Shanghai have functioned well, but there is still a lack of sufficient family doctors and specialists, including paediatricians and gynaecologists. Although proportions of the key population (average=62.59%) and the elderly population (>65 years) (average=78.10%) who had signed with family doctors were relatively high, the proportion of the permanent resident population (average=29.36%) who had signed with family doctors was low from 2017 to 2020 in Shanghai. The proportions of residents seeking medical advice in signed community health centres in outskirts (71.08%) were higher than those in suburbs (63.51%) and urban areas (53.49%), whereas the proportion of those seeking medical advice from recommended multiple medical institutions were similarly low in urban areas, outskirts and suburbs.
   Conclusion: The practice of facilitate signing with family doctors in Shanghai has increased. However, we showed that numbers of family doctors were relatively low, and there remains a need for more experienced gynaecology and paediatrics professionals, compared with Western countries. Additionally, efforts should be made to increase proportions of residents who utilize the program, especially in urban areas, and seek medical services in contracted group hospitals and community health centres.

AB Introduction: Community-based rehabilitation service (CBR) is a community development strategy set for persons with disabilities and their families. Measuring caregivers' satisfaction is a recommended approach to know the overall satisfaction of rehabilitation service. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of satisfaction and associated factors among caregivers of children with disabilities towards community-based rehabilitation in Central and North Gondar zone, North West Ethiopia.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to September 2020. The data were collected by socio-demographic variables, types of services, types of disabilities, and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). Data analysis was done by SPSS Version-20 statistical software. Descriptive statistics, bi-variable, and multivariable logistic regression analysis were computed. The multivariable logistic regression analysis model a P-value <0.05 was used to identify the associated factors with caregivers' satisfaction.
   Results: The study showed that the overall caregivers' satisfaction with community-based rehabilitation service among caregivers of children with disabilities was 60.9% (95% CI; 5566%). Female gender (AOR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05-0.68), older age (AOR: 0.160, 95% CI: 0.03-0.85), being farmer (AOR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.05-0.42), North Gondar zone residence (AOR: 7.02, 95% CI: 6.78-8.59), high monthly income (AOR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.09-5.61), got two or more type of service (AOR: 3.65, 95% CI: 2.64-12.39), service duration 8-14 years (AOR: 4.36, 95% CI: 1.44-7.04) and service frequency 5-8 times per month (AOR: 3.91, 95% CI 2.18-7.01) were factors associated with the caregivers' satisfaction on community based-rehabilitation service.
   Conclusion and Recommendation: The magnitude of caregivers' satisfaction with community-based rehabilitation services in the study area was more than half Female gender, older age, being farmer, high monthly income, North Gondar zone residence, the high number of services, duration of services started and frequency of follow-up were factors significantly associated with caregiver's satisfaction.

AB Background: Oral health problems among elderly people are an important public health issues worldwide. Oral healthcare is essential to the health and well-being of elders and is one of the key indicators determining their quality of life. This research aimed to study oral health literacy, self-efficacy, social support, and demographic characteristic factors associated with the oral health care behaviors of elderly people living in the rural areas of northern Thailand.
   Methods: This research was a cross-sectional study that recruited 406 elderly participants using convenience and snowball samplings. Participants' names were obtained from the registration list of the Java Health Center Information System (JHCIS) program, where they received a health service between 2018 and 2020. Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews with participants, while they were waiting to receive a health service or through a phone interview. Linear regression was analyzed to determine the factors associated with oral healthcare behaviors.
   Results: The majority of participants (85%) had inadequate functional health literacy, 52% had moderate self-efficacy toward oral health behaviors, 91.9% had moderate social support, and 53% admitted to moderate oral health behaviors. The results from the model show that self-efficacy, social support, and oral health literacy are positively associated with oral health care behaviors among the elderly (p-value < 0.05). The multiple regression model can account for 47.2% of the variance in oral health care behaviors.
   Conclusion: Improving oral health care behaviors among elderly people should be considered by health care providers and those who provide social support. Self-esteem, communication skills among service providers and service receivers, and self-management of oral healthcare should receive special attention. Moreover, social support and relevant agencies can help promote oral healthcare by collaborating with other healthcare providers for better oral health outcomes among elderly people.

AB Objective This study used a programme logic model to describe the inputs, activities and outputs of the '10,000 Lives' smoking cessation initiative in Central Queensland, Australia. Design A programme logic model provided the framework for the process evaluation of '10,000 Lives'. The data were collected through document review, observation and key informant interviews and subsequently analysed after coding and recoding into classified themes, inputs, activities and outputs. Setting The prevalence of smoking is higher in the Central Queensland region of Australia compared with the national and state averages. In 2017, Central Queensland Hospital and Health Services set a target to reduce the percentage of adults who smoke from 16.7% to 9.5% in the Central Queensland region by 2030 as part of their strategic vision ('Destination 2030'). Achieving this target is equivalent to 20,000 fewer smokers in Central Queensland, which should result in 10,000 fewer premature deaths due to smoking-related diseases. To translate this strategic goal into an actionable smoking cessation initiative, the '10,000 Lives' health promotion programme was officially launched on 1 November 2017. Result The activities of the initiative coordinated by a senior project officer included building clinical and community taskforces, organising summits and workshops, and regular communications to stakeholders. Public communication strategies (e.g., Facebook, radio, community exhibitions of '10,000 Lives' and health-related events) were used to promote available smoking cessation support to the Central Queensland community. Conclusion The '10,000 Lives' initiative provides an example of a coordinated health promotion programme to increase smoking cessation in a regional area through harnessing existing resources and strategic partnerships (e.g., Quitline). Documenting and describing the process evaluation of the '10,000 Lives' model is important so that it can be replicated in other regional areas with high prevalence of smoking.

AB Background: Several modifiable risk factors for dementia have been identified, although the extent to which their modification leads to improved cognitive outcomes remains unclear.
   Objective: The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that a behavior modification intervention program targeting personalized risk factors prevents cognitive decline in community-dwelling, middle-aged adults with a family history of dementia.
   Methods: This is a prospective, risk factor management, blinded endpoint, randomized, controlled trial, where 1510 cognitively normal, community-dwelling adults aged 40-70 years old will be recruited. Participants will be screened for risk factors related to vascular health (including physical inactivity), mental health, sleep, and cognitive/social engagement. The intervention is an online person-centered risk factor management program: BetterBrains. Participants randomized to intervention will receive telehealth-based person-centered goal setting, motivational interviewing, and follow-up support, health care provider communication and community linkage for management of known modifiable risk factors of dementia. Psychoeducational health information will be provided to both control and intervention groups.
   Results: The primary outcome is favorable cognitive performance at 24-months post-baseline, defined as the absence of decline on one or more of the following cognitive tests: (a) Cogstate Detection, (b) Cogstate One Card Learning, (c) Cogstate One Back, and (d) Cognitive Function Instrument total score.
   Conclusion: We will test the hypothesis that the BetterBrains intervention program can prevent cognitive decline. By leveraging existing community services and using a risk factor management pathway that tailors the intervention to each participant, we maximize likelihood for engagement, long-term adherence, and for preserving cognitive function in at-risk individuals.

AB Introduction There is a clear need for improved care quality and quality monitoring in aged care. Aged care providers collect an abundance of data, yet rarely are these data integrated and transformed in real-time into actionable information to support evidence-based care, nor are they shared with older people and informal caregivers. This protocol describes the co-design and testing of a dashboard in residential aged care facilities (nursing or care homes) and community-based aged care settings (formal care provided at home or in the community). The dashboard will comprise integrated data to provide an 'at-a-glance' overview of aged care clients, indicators to identify clients at risk of fall-related hospitalisations and poor quality of life, and evidence-based decision support to minimise these risks. Longer term plans for dashboard implementation and evaluation are also outlined. Methods This mixed-method study will involve (1) co-designing dashboard features with aged care staff, clients, informal caregivers and general practitioners (GPs), (2) integrating aged care data silos and developing risk models, and (3) testing dashboard prototypes with users. The dashboard features will be informed by direct observations of routine work, interviews, focus groups and co-design groups with users, and a community forum. Multivariable discrete time survival models will be used to develop risk indicators, using predictors from linked historical aged care and hospital data. Dashboard prototype testing will comprise interviews, focus groups and walk-through scenarios using a think-aloud approach with staff members, clients and informal caregivers, and a GP workshop. Ethics and dissemination This study has received ethical approval from the New South Wales (NSW) Population & Health Services Research Ethics Committee and Macquarie University's Human Research Ethics Committee. The research findings will be presented to the aged care provider who will share results with staff members, clients, residents and informal caregivers. Findings will be disseminated as peer-reviewed journal articles, policy briefs and conference presentations.

AB Introduction
   In Germany, an efficient and feasible transition from hospital to home for older patients, ensuring continuous care across healthcare settings, has not yet been applied and evaluated. Based on the transitional care model (TCM), this study aims to reduce preventable readmissions of patients >= 75 years of age with a transitional care intervention performed by geriatric-experienced care professionals. The study investigates whether the intervention ensures continuous care during transition and stabilises the care situation of patients at home.
   Methods and analyses
   Randomised controlled clinical trial, recruiting between 25 April 2018 and 31 December 2019 in one German hospital in the city of Regensburg. The intervention group is supported by care professionals in the transition process from hospital to home for up to 12 months. Based on TCM, the intervention includes an individual care plan according to a patient's symptoms, risks, needs and values. The plan is advanced in the domestic situation via personal visits and telephone contacts. All necessary care actions regarding, for example, mobility, residence adjustments, or nutrition, are initiated to be executed by ambulant care services, and are monitored, evaluated and adapted if necessary. In supervising the care plan, the care professionals do not administer active care services themselves but coordinate them. Patients and their caregivers are actively engaged in the care planning and execution. In contrast, the control group receives only usual discharge planning in the hospital and usual ambulatory care.
   The primary outcome is the all-cause readmission rate assessed using health insurance data within a follow-up of up to 12 months after hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes include care quality, mobility, nutritional and wound situation, and health-related quality of life. They are assessed at baseline, after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and at the end of study visit. Additionally, the economic efficiency of the intervention will be evaluated.
   Ethics and dissemination
   Ethics approval for the trial was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg. Results will be published in peer-reviewed, open-access scientific journals and disseminated at national and international research conferences and through public presentations in the geriatric and healthcare community.

AB Background: The proportion of older people is increasing rapidly, bringing tremendous challenges for health services. Primary health centers (PHCs) play a primary role in providing health care to older people. Developing an age-friendly health service recognition (AFHSR) framework for PHCs in Taiwan and evaluating the reliability and validity of this framework are essential.
   Methods: Research was conducted in four stages. First, the initial AFHSR framework was developed based on the health promoting hospital standards. Second, experts (N = 33) including public health researchers, hospital and PHC directors, physical environment architects, and nongovernmental organization managers, modified the framework. Third, two rounds of content validity testing were conducted. Fourth, 25 PHC managers applied the AFSHR framework to evaluate performance.
   Results: The AFHSR framework included two chapters, five standards, and eighteen items. The two chapters were organization management and care services. The five standards were management policy, information intervention and communication, friendly environments, health promotion, and community service and referral. The validity for the framework was 0.96 and for the two chapters was 0.98 and 0.93, respectively. The Cronbach's a of reliability for the whole framework was 0.91 and for the two chapters was 0.85 and 0.81, respectively.
   Conclusions: The AFHSR framework for PHCs is reliable and valid for primary health care in Taiwan. Copyright (C) 2021, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency & Critical Care Medicine.

AB Objective To explore predictors of district nursing care utilisation for community-living (older) people in the Netherlands using claims data. To cope with growing demands in district nursing care, knowledge about the current utilisation of district nursing care is important. Setting District nursing care as a part of primary care. Participants In this nationwide study, claims data were used from the Dutch risk adjustment system and national information system of health insurers. Samples were drawn of 5500 pairs of community-living people using district nursing care (cases) and people not using district nursing care (controls) for two groups: all ages and aged 75+ years (total N=22 000). Outcome measures The outcome was district nursing care utilisation and the 114 potential predictors included predisposing factors (eg, age), enabling factors (eg, socioeconomic status) and need factors (various healthcare costs). The random forest algorithm was used to predict district nursing care utilisation. The performance of the models and importance of predictors were calculated. Results For the population of people aged 75+ years, most important predictors were older age, and high costs for general practitioner consultations, aid devices, pharmaceutical care, ambulance transportation and occupational therapy. For the total population, older age, and high costs for pharmaceutical care and aid devices were the most important predictors. Conclusions People in need of district nursing care are older, visit the general practitioner more often, and use more and/or expensive medications and aid devices. Therefore, close collaboration between the district nurse, general practitioner and the community pharmacist is important. Additional analyses including data regarding health status are recommended. Further research is needed to provide an evidence base for district nursing care to optimise the care for those with high care needs, and guide practice and policymakers' decision-making.

TI Situation of Integrated Eldercare Services with Medical Care in China
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Pension; integrated eldercare services with medical care; operation mode
ID LONG-TERM-CARE
AB There are clinics around nursing homes in foreign countries or family doctors for every elderly. When a disease occurs, doctors can provide door to door service to help patients. Since the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019, the elderly have been a high risk group of people infected with coronavirus disease 2019. In both the United States and Canada, the first recorded coronavirus disease 2019 deaths and outbreaks occurred in nursing homes with case fatality rates in these settings reported to be as high as 33.7 %. Due to the lack of adequate medical facilities and adequate medical staff to provide services, the elderly are more likely to be infected with the virus as a result of social interaction. All these show that foreign models can no longer meet the medical needs of the elderly. Therefore, we should take a different perspective and combine pension services with medical care. At present, China is exploring the mode of combination of medical and nursing services. In this study, we investigated the current situation of integrated medical and nursing services in China, exploring the transformation of primary medical institutions into medical and nursing service providers. The integrated eldercare services with medical care is that we make use of the existing medical resources to provide care services, which can meet the health needs of the elderly and reduce the infection rate of the elderly. Using a self-administered or interview questionnaire survey, we conducted t-test and one-way analysis of variance. It was found that the elderly are most satisfied with the geographical location (90.84 %) and medical services (90.82 %), and the most dissatisfied with consultation (87.66 %) and institutional fees (87.23 %). The elderly with the older age, the higher the monthly income of more than 3000 yuan, marriage and chronic diseases, are highly satisfied with their community health service institutions (p<0.05). Through one-way analysis of variance, there were significant differences in medical and health service demand among the groups with different monthly income (f=5.289 and 5.312, p<0.05), different occupation (f=5.574 and 2.325, p<0.05), and different ideal mode of providing for the aged (f=5.237, p=0.002<0.05). By independent sample t test, it was found that there were significant differences in basic medical service demand and health guidance service demand between people with chronic diseases and those without chronic diseases (p<0.05), and those who were willing and unwilling to use information technology for disease management (p<0.05). Through regression analysis, we can see that age (t=4.411, p<0.05) and income (t=2.061, p<0.05) have significant influence on basic medical service among the three variables of age, education and monthly income, and the coefficient is positive. Age (t=2.508, p<0.05) and income (t=3.143, p<0.05) had significant influence on rehabilitation guidance service, and the coefficient was positive. In summary, age, income, occupation, whether suffering from chronic diseases, whether they are willing to use information technology to detect and manage diseases and other factors, all affect the demand of the elderly for basic medical services and rehabilitation guidance services in medical service institutions. Through the research on the current situation of the integrated medical and nursing services in China, this study enriches the relevant evidence of the integrated medical and nursing services, and has a certain reference value for the relevant management departments to formulate policiesis.

AB Background As China is still in the process of establishing the hierarchical medical system, people have full autonomy in choosing medical institutions when they need to see a doctor. The basic working of a hierarchical medical system involves four parts: primary treatment at the community level, two-way referral, a partition of emergency and chronic disease, and a joint effort among different healthcare facilities. This study examines factors associated with primary healthcare use in a middle-aged and elderly Chinese population.
   Methods Our study is a cross-sectional and observational survey involving 1659 adults aged 45 and above. The data are from the 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. According to the Andersen behavioral model, we used logistic regression to analyze the influencing factors of healthcare services utilization, including predisposing, enabling, and need factors. We also compared the relative importance of factors to healthcare services utilization by analysis of variance.
   Results During the recently 1-month period, 63.89% of the sample had their last visit to a primary healthcare facility. In the final logistic model, there were three predisposing characteristics (education level, children number, and work status), three enabling factors (household status, out-of-pocket expenses, and travel time to the healthcare facilities), and one need factor (three specific chronic diseases) were significantly associated with primary healthcare use. Having received more education, taking more travel time to the healthcare facility, paying more out-of-pocket expenses, and having heart problems were associated with a lower probability of choosing the primary healthcare facility. However, having more children, being still at work, with agricultural household status, diabetes, and arthritis were associated with a higher likelihood of having primary healthcare facility visits. Among all the factors, the three most powerful determinants were out-of-pocket expenses, travel time to the healthcare facility, and education.
   Conclusions Policymakers need to consider these factors when improving the system of primary treatment at the community level, including improving reimbursement policy to distinguish the payment standard between hospitals and primary healthcare facilities.

AB Background: Smart home and telemonitoring technologies have often been suggested to assist health care workers in supporting older people to age in place. However, there is limited research examining diverse information needs of different groups of health care workers and their access to appropriate information technologies.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the issues associated with using technologies that connect older people to their health care providers to support aging in place and enhance older people's health and well-being.
   Methods: Seven focus group discussions were conducted comprising 44 health care professionals who provided clinic-based or in-home services to community-dwelling older people. Participants were asked about their information needs and how technology could help them support older people to age in place. The recordings of the sessions were transcribed and thematically analyzed.
   Results: The perspectives varied between the respondents who worked in primary care clinics and those who worked in community-based services. Three overarching themes were identified. The first theme was "access to technology and systems," which examined the different levels of technology in use and the problems that various groups of health care professionals had in accessing information about their patients. Primary care professionals had access to good internal information systems but they experienced poor integration with other health care providers. The community-based teams had poor access to technology. The second theme was "collecting and sharing of information," which focused on how technology might be used to provide them with more information about their patients. Primary care teams were interested in telemonitoring for specific clinical indicators but they wanted the information to be preprocessed. Community-based teams were more concerned about gaining information on the patients' social environment. The third theme was that all respondents identified similar "barriers to uptake": cost and funding issues, usability of systems by older people, and information security and privacy concerns.
   Conclusions: The participants perceived the potential benefits of technologies, but they were concerned that the information they received should be preprocessed and integrated with current information systems and tailored to the older people's unique and changing situations. Several management and governance issues were identified, which needed to be resolved to enable the widespread integration of these technologies into the health care system. The disconnected nature of the current information architecture means that there is no clear way for sensor data from telemonitoring and smart home devices to be integrated with other patient information. Furthermore, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers also need to be resolved. This study highlights the importance and the complexity of management and governance of systems to collect and disseminate such information. Further research into the requirements of all stakeholder groups and how the information can be processed and disseminated is required.

AB Background:
   The strain on health care services is increasing due to an ageing population and the increasing prevalence of chronic health conditions. eHealth could contribute to optimise effective and efficient care to older adults with one or more chronic health conditions in the general practice.
   Aim:
   The aim of this study was to identify the needs, barriers and facilitators amongst community-dwelling older adults (60+) suffering from one or more chronic health conditions, in using online eHealth applications to support general practice services.
   Methods:
   A qualitative study, using semi-structured followed by think-aloud interviews, was conducted in the Netherlands. The semi-structured interviews, supported by an interview guide were conducted and analysed thematically. The think-aloud method was used to collect data about the cognitive process while the participant was completing a task within online eHealth applications. Verbal analysis according to the Chi approach was conducted to analyse the think-aloud interviews.
   Findings:
   A total of n = 19 older adults with a mean age of 73 years participated. The ability to have immediate contact with the GP on important health issues was identified as an important need. Identified barriers were non-familiarity with the online eHealth applications and a mismatch of user health needs. The low computer experience resulted in non-familiarity with the online eHealth applications. Faltering applications resulted in participants refusing to participate in the use of online eHealth applications. Convenience, efficiency and the instant availability of eHealth via applications were identified as important facilitators.
   Conclusion:
   To improve the use and acceptability of eHealth applications amongst older adults in the general practice, the applications should be tailored to meet individual needs. More attention should be given to improving the user-friendliness of these applications and to the promotion of the benefits such as facilitating older adults independent living for longer.

AB Background and Objectives: Literature calls for larger studies with empirically tested instruments about the meaning of place for older adults-studies that include a broader range of domains and neighborhood characteristics. Although rich narrative and qualitative data for small groups of older individuals exist, a measure with valid and reliable scores that includes the new, multiple domains about aging in place does not.
   Research Design and Methods: Findings are reported from a two-phase, nine-step, exploratory sequential mixed-methods process of measurement development for the Person-Place Fit Measure for Older Adults (PPFM-OA). In Phase I, a focus group (n = 8) and qualitative interviews (n = 77) with persons 65 and older were used to develop emerging domains of aging in place. Qualitative data about concepts and language informed the development of a quantitative item pool for the Mechanical Turk-distributed survey. Phase II included a Delphi process reducing the number of items in the PPFM-OA. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and reliability analysis further reduced the number of potential measure items.
   Results: Five factors emerged from the EFA. They were primary or basic needs/necessities (alpha = .84), neighborhood changes and moving (alpha = .88), identity and place attachment (alpha = .86), community value (alpha = .89), and services and resources (alpha = .78).
   Discussion and Implications: The development of a measure, such as the PPFM-OA, is crucial as more programs and services are created to address aging in place but uniform data for planning and evaluation are lacking. These initial quantitative analyses are informative for the next step, a larger-scale, quantitative evaluation.

AB Purpose To describe the patterns of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) consumption in the Netherlands; to test if exposure to the food environment is associated with UPFs consumption; and if this association differed across educational levels and neighbourhood urbanisation. Methods Cross-sectional study using 2015-data of 8104 older adults from the Dutch EPIC cohort. Proportion of UPFs consumption was calculated from a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Exposure to the food environment was defined as proximity and availability of supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, full-service restaurants, convenience stores, candy stores and cafes. Consumption of UPFs was expressed as both percentage of total grams and total kilocalories. Results The study population was aged 70(+/- 10 SD) years and 80.5% was female. Average UPFs consumption was 17.8% of total food intake in grams and 37% of total energy intake. Those who consumed greater amounts of UPFs had a poorer overall diet quality. Adjusted linear regression models showed that closer proximity and larger availability to any type of food retailer was associated with lower UPFs consumption (both in grams and kilocalories). Somewhat stronger significant associations were found for proximity to restaurants (beta = - 1.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = - 2.6; - 0.6), and supermarkets (beta = - 2.2%, 95%CI = - 3.3; - 1.1); i.e., Individuals living within 500 m from the closest supermarket, as compared to 1500 m, had 2.6% less calories from UPFs. No differences were found on analyses stratified for urbanisation and education. Conclusions Using various measures of exposure to the food environment, we found that exposure to restaurants and supermarkets was associated with somewhat lower consumption of UPFs.

AB We examine social equity in a complex community-based controlled hunting program in the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia. We use a grounded qualitative approach and apply a multi-dimensional equity framework to assess locals' perceptions of equity in the distribution of benefits and costs, the processes of engagement and participation, and the recognition of traditional land use practices and values, paying attention to the inter- and intra-community power dynamics, institutional characteristics, and broader contextual factors that shape perceptions. We conducted interviews with 15 focus groups across four communities and contrast two community-based management models: one that employs a community power sharing mechanism and one without. In each community, we stratified respondents into groups of young men, elder men, women, and community leaders to respect differences in gender, age, and role in the community. The results demonstrate the interweaving effects that broader contextual factors, individual characteristics, and institutional support have on equity perceptions. Important contextual dimensions included pre-existing and ongoing social, political, and economic processes such as population growth and land scarcity, legacy of land use interactions, lack of community infrastructure, and youthled political activism and unrest. Individual attributes that influenced perceptions included landlessness and joblessness among the youth, the extreme reliance of women on forest products for subsistence, and the traditional value systems and practices among elders. Access to information, transparency of decision making, and the presence of monitoring and accountability also influenced perceived equity. This study contributes to the literature on community-based conservation by demonstrating how and why local's concepts of fairness diverge from generic and externally defined notions of equitability. Moving forward, equity assessments need to evaluate local actor's diverse and contextualized relationships with other actors and the natural world, and give recognition to how perceptions interplay with broader social and environmental processes, prior to designing and implementing conservation programs.

AB (1) Background: This study aims to examine the association between service quality for sports and active aging and the impacts on different age cohorts; (2) Methods: This cross-sectional study used a convenience sample of 545 Japanese community sports club (CSC) members over 60 years old, recruited from across eight CSCs in Japan between 2012-2013. A self-administered questionnaire was used to measure the self-reported health status of the elderly, evaluations to CSCs, demographic characteristics, and information on sports programs; (3) Results: The results of multiple logistic regression showed that domains of general evaluation for sports (OR = 1.942 and 95% CI 1.336 similar to 2.824), benefits of sports (OR = 1.659 and 95% CI 1.344 similar to 2.047), and management in sports (OR = 1.273 and 95% CI 1.011 similar to 1.603) were important for club members aged 60-64, the young-old, and the old-old, respectively. With a reduced model for elderly members, stratified analyses showed a significant impact of service quality for sports on active aged people in the benefits and management domains, regardless of sociodemographic information or club participation behavior; (4) Conclusions: The findings suggest that the services encountered in sports are key to promoting health in a community. Service quality in age segmentation should be considered to promote and manage active aging in the future

AB Technological advances in elderly care have been rapid, and the introduction of robots in care will be a topical issue in the near future. There has been little research into the possibility of influencing care workers' attitudes towards robots by project activities, and how to make the change easier for work communities. This study focuses on a robotics project that took place in elderly and home care services in one municipality in Finland (total of 45 care workers). During the project, four robotics workshops and one extended pilot session were implemented. The study follows quasi-experimental settings, and it included two measurements (before and after project activities) and a control group, but no randomization. The data were collected by questionnaires and were analyzed statistically. The project under study brought about minor positive changes in home care workers' attitudes towards the usefulness of care robots. In the final measurement, the difference between the test group and the control group was significant in the two dimensions of positive attitudes. The research supports the hypothesis that project activities can be used to influence home care workers' attitudes towards robots. This can also facilitate the introduction of care robots in home care services. However, the construction of a technology-positive care culture is a long-term process, which requires training and development, technological development and strong strategic management at various levels.

AB Background: Poor mental health is common later in life and is a crucial factor in determining older adults' ability to live independently in the community. Existing nurse-led proactive self-care programs for older adults focus on physical health, since many are living with chronic diseases. Little is known about their effectiveness on the psychological outcomes of independent, non-frail community-dwelling older adults.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of a nurse-led proactive self-care program with a health-social partnership model for community-dwelling older adults on depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and the mental component of health-related quality of life.
   Design and Methods: This was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Adults aged 60 or over who lived within the service areas and scored >= 18 in the Mini-Mental Status Examination were included. Data were collected using questionnaires pre- (T1), post- (T2), and three month after the intervention (T3). The program provided a comprehensive assessment, health and self-management information, and empowerment, and promoted the accessibility of community services by building a health-social partnership network in the community. Generalized Estimating Equation was used to calculate the group, time, and interaction effects. Intention-to-treat was employed as the primary analysis in this study.
   Results: Of the 843 potential community-dwelling older adults who were assessed for eligibility, 457 eligible participants were randomized into the intervention (n = 230) or control group (n = 227). Among them, 175 (76.0%) participants in the intervention group and 190 (83.7%) participants in the control group completed data collection at T3, 6 months after T2 at the completion of the program. The results showed a significant time effect between T1 and T2 (Wald chi(2) = 25.7, p <.001) and T1 and T3 (Wald chi(2) = 7.40, p =.007) in terms of the presence of depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Interprofessional care addressing health and social needs improves the depressive symptoms among older adults dwelling in the community. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Almost half of people living with HIV (PLWH) in the USA are over 50 years of age; this is expected to increase to 70% by 2020. Yet, few interventions exist for older PLWH that address psychological and physical symptoms combined, both prevalent in this population. There is a need to find innovative and accessible interventions that can help older PLWH to manage their symptoms. Mind-body interventions, like tai chi/qigong (TCQ), improve both physical and psychological health. TCQ is a series of slow, low-impact meditative movements that integrates breathwork, meditation, and stances.
   Methods: The present study is an exploratory clinical trial that will evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a 12-week, small group TCQ intervention (n = 24), a sham qigong control condition (n = 24), and a standard of care control condition (n = 24) for older people living with HIV/AIDS. It will also explore any preliminary associations between the TCQ intervention and symptom alleviation. Participants will be recruited from community-based health and social services organizations in Miami, FL, and randomized to one of the 3 conditions.
   Discussion: We will assess feasibility and acceptability through questionnaires and adherence to TCQ. We will assess preliminary associations with symptoms such as depression, anxiety, social support, chronic HIV-related fatigue, and clinical outcomes. These will be described through proportions, means, and changes over time through graphing techniques. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, at post-intervention, and at 3 months follow-up. These preliminary analyses also will provide information necessary to estimate effect size and power needed for a larger clinical trial.

TI Quantifying the economic benefit of the personal alarm and emergency
   response system in Australia: a cost analysis of the reduction in
   ambulance attendances

AB Objectives. MePACS is a triage and support-based personal alarm emergency response system designed to assist older and/or disabled people to live safely in their homes. The aim of this study was to estimate avoidable ambulance attendances and transports to emergency departments and quantify the cost savings attributed to MePACS compared with a comparison cohort without a personal alarm system.
   Methods. Alarm activation and demographic data for clients registered in the program from June 2016 to May 2017 and funded through the Personal Alert Victoria program were extracted from routinely collected MePACS electronic data. Information on alarm use, event outcomes and ambulance attendances was extracted. Using published Ambulance Victoria data, a comparison cohort was simulated to model the experience of a similar cohort without access to a personal alarm system who experienced a health emergency and called Australia's emergency call service number. The incremental management cost, incorporating the operation cost of MePACS and ambulance fees, was calculated to compare the potential cost savings of MePACS with the comparison cohort.
   Results. Among 18 421 eligible clients, there were 7856 emergency alarm activations due to falls or medical events from 4275 clients (79.5% female; 81.1% aged >75 years; 91.8% living alone). MePACS resulted in approximately one-third of ambulance attendances being avoided. Potential annual cost savings of A$1 414 732.8 (A$76.8 per person per year; 95% confidence interval A$60.0-93.6 per person per year;P < 0.001) were attributed to avoidable ambulance utilisations for 18 421 MePACS clients.
   Conclusion. Triage-based personal alarm systems, such as MePACS, provide a cost-saving strategy because of fewer ambulance attendances and transports to emergency departments for older and/or disabled people living in the community.
   What is known about the topic? Personal alarm systems, either a safety alarm, a panic alarm or a medical alarm, have been widely used to support older people and at-risk groups to live independently. The health effects of personal alarm systems are well documented. There is limited information published on the potential economic benefits of these interventions.
   What does this paper add? We identified the potential economic benefits associated with the MePACS triage-based personal alarm system operating within Victoria, Australia. Personal alarm systems that are triage based and use the support of family members and carers may provide financial benefits not provided by alarm systems that do not provide this type of service.
   What are the implications for practitioners? The management of older people and at-risk groups living alone is a health care priority. Alternative models to calling emergency services, such as triage-based personal emergency response systems, may provide a low-cost, effective approach.

TI Engaging "hard-to-reach" men in health promotion using the OPHELIA
   principles: Participants' perspectives
SO HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English

DE equity; health literacy; men's health
ID SERVICES
AB Issue addressed Men in the Northern Suburbs of Launceston, Tasmania, experience substantially poorer health outcomes and socio-economic disadvantage than most Australians. They are often described as "hard-to-reach," meaning difficult to engage in research, health promotion, policy and planning. This paper summarises the OPHELIA process to combine health literacy profiling with engagement of local men in health promotion, and their experience of the process and outcomes. Methods Interviews were conducted to explore the experiences of middle-aged men with the OPHELIA process and subsequent interventions. Results Local data and health literacy profiling revealed experiences of isolation, lack of trust in the system, medication non-adherence, mental illness and chronic pain, which formed the basis for generation of ideas to improve their well-being and understanding of health. Tailored interventions were implemented, including suicide prevention, "Numeracy for Life" and "Healthy Sheds" courses. Interviews with six participants revealed that the process contributed to a sense of worth, social support and ability to break "old habits." Conclusions Prioritising the lived experience of "hard-to-reach" men through the OPHELIA process resulted in co-design of interventions that were valued by participants. So what? Health literacy profiling and genuine community engagement can empower vulnerable, under-represented communities to co-design, and engage in, health promotion.

AB Background: The increasing health service demand driven by the aging of the global population calls for the development of modes of health service delivery that are less human resource-intensive. Electronic health (eHealth) and medical apps are expected to play an important role in this development. Although evidence shows mobile medical apps might be effective in improving the care, self-management, self-efficacy, health-related behavior, and medication adherence of older adults, little is known about older adults' intention to use these technologies when needed, or the factors influencing this intention.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of technology acceptance factors and intention to use mobile medical apps among community-dwelling older adults.
   Methods: Data was collected using questionnaires. The factors selected from the literature have been validated using Cronbach alpha and tested for significance using logistic regressions.
   Results: Almost half (49.7%) of the included older adults reported no intention to use medical apps. Adjusted logistic regression analysis per factor showed that the factors Attitude toward use (odds ratio [OR] 8.50), Perceived usefulness (OR 5.25), Perceived ease of use (OR 4.22), Service availability (OR 3.46), Sense of control (OR 3.40), Self-perceived effectiveness (OR 2.69), Facilities (OR 2.45), Personal innovativeness (OR 2.08), Social relationships (OR 1.79), Subjective norm (OR 1.48), and Feelings of anxiety (OR 0.62) significantly influenced the intention to use mobile medical apps among older adults, whereas the factor Finance (OR 0.98) did not. When considered together, a controlled multivariate logistic regression yielded high explained variances of 0.542 (Cox-Snell R-2) and 0.728 (Nagelkerke R-2).
   Conclusions: The high odds ratios and explained variance indicate that the factors associated with the intention to use medical apps are largely understood and the most important factors have been identified. To advance the evidence base, experimental controlled research should investigate the causality between the factors, intention to use, and actual use. For this purpose, our evidence suggests that policies designed to improve Attitude toward use appear most effective, followed by policies addressing Perceived usefulness, Perceived ease of use, Service availability, and Sense of control.

AB Falls are the leading cause of injury and hospitalisation for older adults (aged 65 years or older) worldwide. Data collected by community aged care providers are an underutilised source of information about precipitating risk factors and consequences of falls for older adults living in the community. The objective of this longitudinal, observational study was to describe and compare the characteristics of older Australians who did and did not have falls reported by community aged care staff. We analysed 19 months of routinely collected care management and incident data for 1,596 older clients from a large Australian community care provider. Differences in sociodemographic characteristics, care needs and community care service use were compared between those who had one or more reported falls and those who had none. Fall-related outcomes (injuries, hospitalisations, relocation to residential aged care) were examined. The average age of clients was 82 years and most were women (66%). Seventy-seven (4.8%) clients had one or more reported falls over the study period (total falls = 92). Clients who had falls reported by care staff were more likely to be older adults, male and use more hours of community care services per week. There were 38 falls-related injuries, 5 falls-related hospitalisations and 20 clients relocated to residential aged care after a reported fall. This study demonstrates the potential for using routinely collected community aged care data to understand risk factors and monitor longitudinal outcomes for a population at high risk of falls.

TI A Proactive Mobile Health Application Program for Promoting Self-Care
   Health Management among Older Adults in the Community: Study Protocol of
   a Three-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial
SO GERONTOLOGY
LA English

ID PROFESSIONALS
AB Background: The use of mobile health (mHealth) has become common in recent years and is regarded as one of the most effective interventions for developing disease-specific management skills and establishing confidence in making preventive health behavior changes and accomplishing health-related goals among community-dwelling older adults. Most mHealth designs adopt a reactive care approach whereby health care professionals do not respond until they receive abnormal assessment results from the database or a message or signal from the client. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a proactive mobile health application program with the support of a community health-social care team for older adults dwelling in the community on improving their self-care health management. Methods: This is a three-armed, randomized controlled trial. The study will be conducted in 7 community centers with an estimated sample size of 282 participants. The participants will be randomly assigned to mHealth with interactivity, mHealth, and control groups when they are (1) aged 60 or above, (2) complaining chiefly of pain, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus, (3) living within the service areas, and (4) smartphone users. Subjects in the mHealth with interactivity group will receive 2 main elements, the mHealth application and nurse case management supported by a social service team. The mHealth group will receive the mHealth application only. The primary outcome measure will be self-efficacy, and secondary outcomes will include self-management outcomes (pain score, blood pressure, capillary blood glucose), client outcomes (quality of life, depression), and health service utilization outcomes (institutionalization and health service utilization [general practitioner, outpatient clinic, emergency room, hospital admission]). Data will be collected before intervention, after intervention, and 3 months after intervention. Discussion: The incremental benefits of adding interactivity in the mHealth program have not been confirmed. This present study will add valuable information to the knowledge gap of whether mHealth with nurse interaction supported by a health-social partnership can improve self-care management among community-dwelling older adults.

AB This study explored the implementation of multidimensional preventive home visits targeted to older adults living in a disadvantaged community in Denmark. The intervention was adapted to include the following key components: involvement of community members in recruitment processes; a combination of individual and group-based dissemination; adaptation of materials to overcome language barriers; and diversity-sensitivity training for professionals. The study took place over 12 months between August 2016 and August 2017 and used various data sources: registry-based data, participant observations, combined with individual and focus group interviews with the target population (n = 22) and relevant health care professionals (n = 8). Here, we report on findings pertaining to implementation barriers and facilitators as seen from the perspective of professionals. Socioeconomic vulnerability was prominent, and uptake of health care services was low, indicating under-utilisation. Implementation facilitators and barriers were identified including potentials in nurturing local partnerships and proximity during recruitment; overcoming language barriers; offering diversity-sensitivity training for professionals; and a need for a more multidisciplinary, comprehensive scope of preventive visits for diverse older adults in disadvantaged communities. Thus, more focus on participatory, comprehensive and community-based health promotion are needed to ensure healthy ageing in the context of social inequality and ethnic diversity.

AB Background: A clinical algorithm (Algo) in paper form is used in Quebec, Canada, to allow health care workers other than occupational therapists (OTs) to make bathroom adaptation recommendations for older adults. An integrated knowledge transfer process around Algo suggested an electronic version of this decision support system (electronic decision support system [e-DSS] to be used by older adults and their caregivers in search of information and solutions for their autonomy and safety in the bathroom.
   Objective: This study aims to (1) create an e-DSS for the self-selection of bathroom-assistive technology by community-dwelling older adults and their caregivers and (2) assess usability with lay users and experts to improve the design accordingly.
   Methods: On the basis of a user-centered design approach, the process started with content identification for the prototype through 7 semistructured interviews with key informants of various backgrounds (health care providers, assistive technology providers, and community services) and 4 focus groups (2 with older adults and 2 with caregivers). A thematic content transcript analysis was carried out and used during the creation of the prototype. The prototype was refined iteratively using think-aloud and observation methods with a clinical expert (n=1), researchers (n=3), OTs (n=3), older adults (n=3), and caregivers (n=3), who provided information on the usability of the e-DSS.
   Results: Overall, 4 themes served as the criteria for the prototype of the electronic Algo (Hygiene 2.0 [H-2.0]): focus (safety, confidentiality, well-being, and autonomy), engage, facilitate (simplify, clarify, and illustrate), and access. For example, users first pay attention to the images (engage and illustrate) that can be used to depict safe postures (safety), illustrate questions embedded in the decision support tool (clarify and illustrate), and demonstrate the context of the use of assistive technology (safety and clarify).
   Conclusions: The user-centered design of H-2.0 allowed the cocreation of an e-DSS in the form of a website, in line with the needs of community-dwelling older adults and their caregivers seeking bathroom-assistive technology that enables personal hygiene. Each iteration improved usability and brought more insight into the users' realities, tailoring the e-DSS to the implementation context.

TI Unfilled Prescriptions of Medicare Beneficiaries: Prevalence, Reasons,
   and Types of Medicines Prescribed
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE & SPECIALTY PHARMACY

DT Article

AB BACKGROUND: Despite the proven efficacy of prescription regimens in reducing disease symptoms and preventing or minimizing complications, poor medication adherence remains a significant public health problem. Medicare beneficiaries have high rates of chronic illness and prescription medication use, making this population particularly vulnerable to nonadherence. Failure to fill prescribed medication is a key component of nonadherence.
   OBJECTIVES: To (1) determine the rates of self-reported failure to fill at least 1 prescription among a sample of Medicare beneficiaries in 2004, (2) identify the reasons for not filling prescribed medication, (3) examine the characteristics of Medicare beneficiaries who failed to fill their prescription(s), and (4) identify the types of medications that were not obtained.
   METHODS: The study is a secondary analysis of the 2004 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), an ongoing national panel survey conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Medicare beneficiaries living in the community (N = 14,464) were asked: "During the current year [2004], were there any medicines prescribed for you that you did not get (please include refills of earlier prescriptions as well as prescriptions that were written or phoned in by a doctor)?" Those who responded "yes" to this question (n = 664) were asked to identify the specific medication(s) not obtained. Rates of failure to fill were compared by demographic and income categories and for respondents with versus without self-reported chronic conditions, identified by asking respondents if they had ever been told by a doctor that they had the condition. Weighted population estimates for nonadherence were calculated using Professional Software for Survey Data Analysis for Multi-stage Sample Designs (SUDAAN) to account for the MCBS multistage stratified cluster sampling process. Unweighted counts of the prescriptions not filled by therapeutic class were calculated using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS).
   RESULTS: In 2004, an estimated 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries (4.4%) failed to fill or refill 1 or more prescriptions. The most common reasons cited for failure to fill were: "thought it would cost too much" (55.5%), followed by "medicine not covered by insurance" (20.2%), "didn't think medicine was necessary for the condition" (18.0%), and "was afraid of medicine reactions/contraindications" (11.8%). Rates of failure to fill were significantly higher among Medicare beneficiaries aged 18 to 64 years eligible through Social Security Disability Insurance (10.4%) than among beneficiaries aged 65 years or older (3.3%, P < 0.001). Rates were slightly higher for women than for men (5.0 vs. 3.6%, P = 0.001), for nonwhite than for white respondents (5.5% vs. 4.2%, P = 0.010), and for dually eligible Medicaid beneficiaries than for those who did not have Medicaid coverage (6.3% vs. 4.0% P = 0.001). Failure-to-fill rates were significantly higher among beneficiaries with psychiatric conditions (8.0%, P < 0.001); arthritis (5.2%, P < 0.001); cardiovascular disease (5.2%, P = 0.003); and emphysema, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6.6%, P < 0.001) than among respondents who did not report those conditions, and the rate for respondents who reported no chronic conditions was 2.5%. Rates were higher for those with more self-reported chronic conditions (3.2%, 4.0%, 4.3%, and 5.9% for those with 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more conditions, respectively, P < 0.001). Among the prescriptions not filled (993 prescriptions indentified by 664 respondents), central nervous system agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, were most frequently identified (23.6%, n = 234), followed by cardiovascular agents (18.3%, n = 182) and endocrine/metabolic agents (6.5%, n = 65). Of the reported unfilled prescriptions, 8.1% were for antihyperlipidemic agents, 5.4% were for antidepressant drugs, 4.6% were for antibiotics, and 29.9% were for unidentified therapy classes.
   CONCLUSION: Most Medicare beneficiaries fill their prescriptions, but some subpopulations are at significantly higher risk for nonadherence associated with unfilled prescriptions, including working-age beneficiaries, dual-eligible beneficiaries, and beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. Self-reported unfilled prescriptions included critical medications for treatment of acute and chronic disease, including antihyperlipidemic agents, antidepressants, and antibiotics.

AB Digital health literacy (DHL) is the ability to search, understand and evaluate information from digital media and apply that knowledge to solve health problems. However, currently many citizens have not developed these skills, and this compromises not only the self-management of their health, but the possibility that health services are socially sustainable. The objective of this article was to present the objectives, activities and results of the IC-Health project whose objective was to develop a series of massive open online courses (MOOCs) to improve the DHL skills of European citizens. An exploratory report on DHL's current evidence was developed. Furthermore, a survey, focus groups and group interviews were conducted to determine DHL levels and the needs of population cohorts (children; adolescents; pregnant and lactating women; the elderly; and people affected by type 1 and type 2 diabetes). A participation strategy with end users was designed through a community of practice for the creation of MOOCs with the seven European countries that participated in the consortium. Thirty-five MOOCs were developed in eight different languages and a descriptive and exploratory assessment of MOOCs was conducted with new participants. This first evaluation indicated that MOOCs can be an effective educational resource for DHL and a facilitator of shared decision-making processes. The process of co-creation of MOOCs, the components, the challenges and the opportunities identified in this European project could be useful for other developers of MOOCs who want to co-create interventions with beneficiaries in similar settings. Further longer-term actions are still needed to improve citizens' DHL.

AB As US society ages, pressures on local government planning and service delivery increase. We conducted a national survey of 1474 US local governments in 2013 to measure the range of services local governments provide and how these relate to local planning processes, public engagement and local government attitudes and motivators. We differentiate measures of public engagement and cross-agency collaboration, and control for built environment, demographic structure, socio-economics and metro status to explain what differentiates communities that provide more services. Our regression models find communities with more cross-agency collaboration (for service delivery, information and trust) and more engagement of older adults and families with children, provide more services to meet their needs. Capacity constraints do not differentiate level of service delivery. Local governments with conservative councils provide fewer services for children and seniors. Communities with increasing senior populations, and suburbs with increasing child populations provide fewer services targeted to their needs.

AB Background As part of a broader study to improve the capacity for advance care planning (ACP) in primary healthcare settings, the research team set out to develop and validate a computerized algorithm to help primary care physicians identify individuals at risk of death, and also carried out focus groups and interviews with relevant stakeholder groups. Interviews with patients and family caregivers were carried out in parallel to algorithm development and validation to examine (1) views on early identification of individuals at risk of deteriorating health or dying; (2) views on the use of a computerized algorithm for early identification; and (3) preferences and challenges for ACP. Methods Fourteen participants were recruited from two Canadian provinces. Participants included individuals aged 65 and older with declining health and self-identified caregivers of individuals aged 65 and older with declining health. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via telephone. A qualitative descriptive analytic approach was employed, which focused on summarizing and describing the informational contents of the data. Results Participants supported the early identification of patients at risk of deteriorating health or dying. Early identification was viewed as conducive to planning not only for death, but for the remainder of life. Participants were also supportive of the use of a computerized algorithm to assist with early identification, although limitations were recognized. While participants felt that having family physicians assume responsibility for early identification and ACP was appropriate, questions arose around feasibility, including whether family physicians have sufficient time for ACP. Preferences related to the content of and approach to ACP discussions were highly individualized. Required supports during ACP include informational and emotional supports. Conclusions This work supports the role of primary care providers in the early identification of individuals at risk of deteriorating health or death and the process of ACP. To improve ACP capacity in primary healthcare settings, compensation systems for primary care providers should be adjusted to ensure appropriate compensation and to accommodate longer ACP appointments. Additional resources and more established links to community organizations and services will also be required to facilitate referrals to relevant community services as part of the ACP process.

AB In this study, the authors evaluate the 2013 consolidation of Iowa's Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) on the delivery of home and community-based services (HCBS) to older adults in the state. A mixed-methods approach combined a quasi-experimental design using longitudinal service delivery data with qualitative analyses of surveys and interviews with AAA staff and clients. Overall, consolidation had no detectable effect on the proportion of older adults served by the AAAs. Subgroup analysis showed that consolidation increased the average proportion of older adults served in nonmetropolitan counties and the proportion served through congregate meals. AAA staff and clients described both positive and negative aspects of consolidation: better collaboration across agencies, improved consistency in services, significant challenges with completing consolidation processes, and serving expanded geographic areas. As the American population ages and budgetary allocations tighten, findings from this evaluation can inform other states considering similar restructuring efforts.

AB Due to the rapid increase in the number of elderly people in Chinese cities, the development and planning of aged care facilities, and particularly community care facilities, which will gradually become the mainstream choice for the elderly in China, is becoming an important topic for urban sustainability. Previous studies have shown that the number and scale of aged care facilities in many cities are far from meeting the needs of the elderly and the overall occupation rate is low. Some of these cities are still expanding and some are undergoing urban renovation. In this process, the scientific planning of community care facilities to promote efficient use of facility resources has become an urgent problem that needs to be solved. In this study, the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method and a potential model based on the Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to carry out a scientific evaluation of the spatial accessibility of community care facilities in the Beilin district of Xi'an. The aims were to explore the best quantitative research methods for assessing the distribution of Xi'an community care facilities' spatial accessibility, provide ideas for similar studies in the future, and further the understanding of spatial allocation of urban community care facilities resources.

TI Pharmacist-led transitions-of-care program reduces 30-day readmission
   rates for Medicare patients in a large health system

ID PATIENTS AFTER-DISCHARGE; ADVERSE EVENTS
AB Purpose. This report describes the growth and development of the Pharmacy Transitions of Care (PTOC) program at a Florida health system and examines its impact on 30-day readmission rates for Medicare core-measure patients.
   Summary. BayCare Health System is a large not-for-profit community health system with 15 hospitals in central Florida. In 2015, the PTOC program was developed to integrate 2 pharmacists into the transitions-of-care space to reduce readmissions, enhance patient care, and improve medication safety. The PTOC program focuses on traditional Medicare beneficiaries 65 years of age or older with the goal of preventing 30-day readmissions. The service model includes integration of a pharmacist into the discharge medication reconciliation process, as well as postacute care telephonic follow-up. Data and outcomes have been carefully tracked since program inception and consistently demonstrate a reduction in 30-day readmissions, with a 63% relative risk reduction during the beginning phases of the program and a ratio of observed to expected readmissions of 0.77. As a result, in less than 3 years the PTOC program has grown from 2 to 23 pharmacists and is a key component of BayCare Health System's patient care strategy.
   Conclusion. Medication reconciliation, clinical interventions, and patient education by pharmacists after hospital discharge reduced 30-day readmission rates for Medicare core-measure patients across a large health system. The adaptability of this program to other health systems and hospitals of varying size to achieve similar outcomes is valuable to share with the profession.

AB Memory disorders have become a major public, social, and health concern among the aging population, and many of those who are affected are cared for at home by their spouse. The aim of this qualitative study was to describe the individual experiences of 10 older caregivers who were looking after a spouse with a memory disorder in 2016. Data were collected from volunteers who were recruited from a memory clinic at a Finnish health center using the thematic interview method and processed using inductive content analysis. The participants were six female and four male caregivers who had been married for over 10 years. The results indicated that caring for a spouse with a memory disorder involved a number of factors. These included the impact of social networks and changes in their everyday life, collaboration with service providers, and the caregivers' well-being. However, our study showed that caregivers felt that the formal multiprofessional services they received were fragmented, which means that they were less likely to provide a holistic approach to caregivers' situations. Better multiprofessional cooperation is needed in the community, including services such as memory clinics, home care and practical services, day centers, and short-term respite in care homes.

   digital inclusion
AB We discuss how a capability approach to information technology in neighbourhoods with low social capital can create embedded and sustainable Community Technology Partnerships (CTPs) that connect residents and institutions together, reducing barriers to social participation and collaborative action. Current research indicates older people in deprived neighbourhoods have chronic problems with the effective sharing of community information, a key factor in the 'digital divide' [Niehaves and Plattfaut (2014). Internet adoption by the elderly: Employing IS technology acceptance theories for understanding the age-related digital divide. European Journal of Information Systems, 23(6), 708 726. hups://doi.org/1 0.1057/ejis.201 3.1 91 Manchester Age Friendly Neighbourhoods had 4,000 conversations in four 'age-friendly' resident-led neighbourhood partnerships in Manchester. This fieldwork demonstrated that the inability to create and share information within and across residents, communities and service providers is a key contributor to social isolation and barrier to local collaboration. MAFN developed a CTP to correlate perceptions that it was difficult to find out what was going on in the neighbourhood, with an exhaustive audit of actual activity. The result was collective surprise at finding out about dozens of events in each area that were previously either poorly communicated or which were not normally published at all, relying entirely on word of mouth. The CTP was developed using a capability model [Kleine (2013). Technologies of choice? ICTs, development, and the capabilities approach. MIT Press] to discover and overcome both the social and technical barriers preventing the hosts of neighbourhood activities collaboratively and sustainably self-publishing their event information. This resulted in the production of PlaceCal, an holistic social and technical toolkit that ensures groups and individuals have the technology, skills, infrastructure and support to publish information, creating a distributed network of community information.

AB Background: Since the recently announced Community Care Policy, there has been an opinion that Korea needs to establish an alternative medical model such as physician home visits. This study aimed to assess the need and willingness to pay (WTP) for physician home visits among the community-dwelling Korean older population and to determine the most important factors that influence older adults to decide to use a physician home visit service.
   Methods: A total of 797 people aged 60 years or older who were randomly selected from a nationwide dataset using a multi-stage stratified sampling method answered a questionnaire on the need and WTP for physician home visits.
   Results: A total of 39.3% of participants reported that they would like a physician home visit when they need help. Among older adults who needed physician home visits (n = 313), the WTP amount for physician home visits was 21,982 +/- 17,546 KRW. Logit and Tobit regression analyses showed that the higher valuated need and WTP for physician home visits was associated with a lower level of physical/psychosocial functioning measured by EuroQol-five dimensions score (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.27; P= 0.035) and a higher level of satisfaction when using community-based services such as public health centers (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02-1.72; P = 0.034), social welfare centers and Gyeong-ro-dang (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.04-2.50; P= 0.033; beta = 8.39; standard error, 3.63; P = 0.021).
   Conclusion: This study provides evidence that the decision to pay for a physician home visit service is based upon the complex interactions among an individual's physical and psychosocial functioning, personal experiences of service utilization, and demographic factors. The value for physician home visits should be qualified based on the empirical data of WTP, which comes from a consumer-centered perspective.

AB Objectives: To discuss the outcomes of a formalized care transition process for palliative care patients from the hospital to the community.
   Background: Patients who received inpatient palliative care services from the specialist palliative care team in the hospital or who were identified as needing community palliative care services have inadequate support on discharge.
   Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of patients admitted to the community based palliative care (CBPC) program, Arizona Palliative Home Care (AZPHC) over a 12-month period (June 2018 to May 2019) was undertaken with a focus on the frequency and pattern of hospital events pre- and postadmission to the program. Patient/family satisfaction data obtained from telephone surveys were evaluated. The medical records from patients (n = 294) with advanced complex illnesses who were admitted to AZPHC from the five Honor Health Network hospitals were included in this study.
   Results: Of the 294 patients' records reviewed, 80% were in the 65 and older age group and had a mean length of stay on AZPHC of similar to 40 days. Comparing acute care utilization pre and post AZPHC admission, there was a reduction of 68.95% at 60 days and 68.22% at 90 days. In addition, 128 avoided hospital events were recorded, and 86% of patients were very likely to recommend AZPHC to family or friends.
   Discussion: Collaboration between a hospital palliative care team and a CBPC program resulted in high quality transitions across care settings and reduction in acute care utilization.

AB Older family carers of people with dementia provide a substantial amount of care for people with dementia in the UK. Caregiving can be stressful and burdensome for these individuals, who are also experiencing psychological and physical changes resulting from their own ageing process. However, little is known about what impacts their quality of life, how this can be improved and what we should prioritise. This brief report asks one simple question to older family carers of people living with dementia - "What would most help improve your quality of life as a carer?" Qualitative data were collected from 150 carers who completed an anonymous paper survey during the development and validation of a quality of life tool for use with this population (DQoL-OC). Participants were individuals aged 60 and over and were providing care for a family member with dementia at home in the UK. Carers were recruited from a variety of voluntary organizations, community-based carers' groups, health services and via online forums. A thematic approach was used to analyse the carers' comments and three main overarching themes were identified. The quality of life of older family carers can be enhanced by having more time away from caregiving, accessing health and social services that are dementia friendly and by having economic support. Future care, policies and research should aim to address these key areas in order to promote better quality of life for older carers of people with dementia. Further implications for practice, policy and research are discussed.

AB In the face of the dynamic ageing of local communities, smart cities and smart villages programs should seek to ensure meeting the needs of the elderly and promoting solutions tailored to their computer literacy, digital skills, and perception capabilities. In this context we propose to approach local smart and age-friendly communities initiatives in a way that would provide responses to two contemporary megatrends: digitalization and demographic transition. We assumed that the deployment of such initiatives in local planning and governance depends on at least two conditions: demand for smart everyday products and services represented by older adults and the perspective of the local decision-makers. The paper aims to examine whether the smart city/smart village idea focused on meeting the needs of the elderly and seeking to shape age-friendly local communities and the environment could be implemented in the municipalities in Poland. The analysis of the elderly Poles' capabilities to absorb the ICT solutions demonstrated that the smart and age-friendly community approach may face implementation difficulties, especially in the oldest groups of the Polish rural population. Results of the quantitative study conducted in 1236 municipalities revealed that local authorities perceive local policy goals, such as pursuing smart and age-friendly development as low priority ones. A citizen-centered approach of village heads and mayors to the local policy is critical for integrating these two priorities of being smart and age-friendly.

AB Introduction:Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are key indicators of general functional status that are frequently used to assess the autonomy of older adults living in the community. Aims:To evaluate the changes in IADL in community-living older adults and the role of common mental disorders and physical multimorbidity in predicting these changes. Method:A secondary analysis including participants from the Longitudinal Survey on Senior's Health and Health Services. Self-reported sociodemographic and clinical information on chronic conditions were obtained at baseline interview (n = 1615). Measures of IADL were obtained at two time points, 3 years apart. Administrative data on physician diagnoses of chronic diseases were linked to self-reported information. Logistic and multinomial regression models were used to study the outcomes of interest. Results:More than one-third of participants reported disability. Significant increase in global and specific IADL tasks disability were observed over time. Concurrent mental and physical chronic conditions predicted persistent and future incidence of disability. Conclusions:We draw attention to the synergistic effect of mental and physical co-morbidities on IADL functioning and to the importance of the simultaneous management of these conditions in order to prevent disability, future decline and the associated health and societal burden.

AB Introduction: Although a large body of research has identified effective models of transitional care, questions remain about the optimal translation of this knowledge into practice. In Australia, the-introduction of a model of consumer-directed care uniquely challenges the practice of integrated care transitions for older adults. This study aimed to identify strengths and weaknesses in transitional care for older adults in an Australian setting by describing healthcare practitioners' experiences of care provision.
   Methods: The study used a qualitative design in two phases: 1) semi-structured interviews, 2) one focus group. The setting comprised one public health network and five community services in urban Australia. In Phase 1, health practitioners across settings were interviewed about their experience of transitional care. Phase 2 sought feedback about the Phase 1 findings from different practitioners. All data were thematically analysed.
   Findings: In Phase 1), 48 healthcare practitioners were interviewed across multiple settings. Few-participants were aware of the introduction of consumer-directed care in community aged care. Four main themes were identified: 'Rapid and safe care transition', 'Discussing as a team', 'Questioning the discharge', and 'Engaging patients and carers'. In Phase 2), seven participants from different settings reviewed and endorsed the findings from Phase 1.
   Discussion and conclusions: Findings indicate that healthcare practitioners use a range of-communication and coordination processes in optimising integrated transitional care. Although participants involved their patients in transitional care planning, most participants were unaware of the recent implementation of consumer-directed care. In contexts of community-based care shaped by multidisciplinary, sub-acute and CDC models, care integration must focus on improved communication with patients and carers to-ascertain their needs and to support their increased responsibility in their care transitions.

AB According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal No. 3 (SDG - Goal 3), for sustainable development it is imperative to ensure health and well-being across all ages, and is achievable only through effective and continuous healthcare monitoring. But in India and other third world countries, healthcare monitoring is poor compared to other countries in the world, in spite of it being affordable. The global healthcare smart wearable healthcare (SWH) devices market is expected to rise up at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5.6% and by 2020 it is expected to reach 25 Billion (GVR Report, 2016). The growing incidences of lifestyle diseases, sedentary lifestyle, busy work schedules, technological advancements in healthcare monitoring devices, and increased usage of remote devices-seems to be some of the important factors fuelling this growth. Some of the major players in this segment are Abbott Laboratories, Philips Healthcare, Life Watch, GE Healthcare, Omron Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare and Honeywell International Inc. etc. But in spite of the healthcare monitoring devices are being predicted to be technologically innovative and providing advanced as well as basic health care monitoring features and available in various price ranges based on the features, we wanted to empirically study the attitude towards adoption of such devices in India. India has traditionally been having a very lackadaisical attitude towards healthcare monitoring. In such a context, what would be the factors influencing the adoption of SWH devices. Remote health monitoring can enhance the nature of wellbeing administration and to lessen the aggregate expense in human services by maintaining a strategic distance from pointless hospitalizations and guaranteeing that the individuals who need critical consideration get it sooner. This empirical investigation would provide a detailed insight as to how these wearable Internet Of Things devices would bring about a revolution in the healthcare industry. It would also provide the future prospect of IOT devices in this sector and how the probability of increase in its usage can be increased with time. The paper explores intrusiveness (INTR), Comfort (C), perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (EOU) of SWH devices. The study hypothesized the Impact of PU and EOU, INTR and C on attitude and intention to use towards adoption of SWH devices. Partial Least Square Structured Equation Modeling (PLS - SEM) methodology was applied to explore the relationships between the concepts and hypothesis. The data was collected from 273 respondents. The age group of the respondents was between 25 and 40 years. The results indicated that intrusiveness and comfort do not have a significant direct impact on Intention to use BI (Behavior Intention) BI SWH devices. At the same time Intrusiveness had a significant impact on PU of SWH devices and Comfort has a strong significant impact on PU and EOU of smart wearables. The research has strong implications in the current emerging context of smart wearables, their design and effectiveness. Also the research can have lasting implications on elderly health and well-being. There are very few empirical studies in the area of SWH devices. Most of the studies till now are conceptual studies or providing technology architectures and frameworks. The research in this area is still at a very nascent stage and very few studies have been done to explore the use and adoption of SWH devices.

AB Background The prevalence of osteoporosis (OP) is rapidly increasing. Healthy behaviors are crucial for the management of OP. Application of the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model has been verified in various chronic diseases, but this model has not been investigated for behavioral interventions among people with OP. This study aimed to examine factors influencing OP self-management behavior and their interaction paths based on the IMB model. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study using a convenience sampling method in 20 community health service centers in Shanghai, China. Predictive relationships between IMB model variables and self-management behaviors were evaluated using an anonymous questionnaire. Structural equation modeling was used to test the IMB model. Results In total, 571 participants completed the questionnaire, of which 461 (80.7%) were female. Participants' mean age was 68.8 +/- 10.1 years. Only 101 (17.7%) participants were classified as having better OP self-management behaviors. The model demonstrated the data had an acceptable fit. Paths from information to self-efficacy (beta = 0.156, P < 0.001) and self-management behaviors (beta = 0.236, P < 0.001), from health beliefs to self-efficacy (beta = 0.266, P < 0.001), from medical system support to self-efficacy (beta = 0.326, P < 0.001) and self-management behaviors (beta = 0.230, P < 0.001), and from self-efficacy to self-management behaviors (beta = 0.376, P < 0.001) were all significant and in the predicted direction. Conclusion This study validated the utility of the IMB model for OP self-management behaviors in this population. Middle-aged and older adult patients with OP have poor self-management behaviors. Enhanced knowledge about OP and is important for improving self-management behaviors.

AB Introduction
   Currently, there are only a small number of comprehensive study results on adherence and acceptance of telemonitoring applications (TMAs) regarding multi-morbid older patients. The ATMoSPHAERE study aimed to develop an information and communication platform for an intersectoral networking of, for example, general practitioners, therapists, social services and the multi-morbid older patient.
   Methods
   The study presented was designed as a longitudinal bicentric intervention study which focused on multi-morbid patients aged >= 65 years using home-based telemedical measurement and input devices. The development and testing of this TMA aimed to optimise patients' health care through intersectoral networking of all treating actors. Quantitative methods of data collection and analysis were used.
   Results
   Patients who completed the study were significantly younger than drop-outs and non-participants. The mental health of study patients significantly improved between the beginning and end of TMA use. The main reason for non-participation in the study was the high time expenditure when participating in the study. No perceived (information) benefits for health and insufficient content variety were the main reasons for drop-out. Appropriateness and handling of TMAs must be aligned with the needs of the heterogeneous user group of multi-morbid patients in order to increase acceptance and the added value of TMAs. Telemonitoring hardware should be oriented on functional capabilities of the older target group. Telemonitoring software content requires an individual, disease-specific approach for patients. The TMA should be unobtrusively integrated into usual daily life and be used to an appropriate extent according to the underlying disease in order to avoid stressing patients. With regard to adherence concerning TMAs, it is crucial to provide a contact person who is always available for patients having problems handling TMAs. Health concerns and questions can thus be addressed early, providing a feeling of safety in the care process.
   Discussion
   User acceptance of TMAs is an essential indicator and driver for use and for future implementation efforts in health care. In order to achieve maximum user centricity in development processes, patients must be involved as experts, co-designers and future users, considering their needs and perceptions.

AB Background: Increasing life expectancy and reducing birth rates indicate that the world population is becoming older, with many challenges related to quality of life for old and fragile people, as well as their informal caregivers. In the last few years, novel information and communication technology techniques generally known as the Internet of Things (IoT) have been developed, and they are centered around the provision of computation and communication capabilities to objects. The IoT may provide older people with devices that enable their functional independence in daily life by either extending their own capacity or facilitating the efforts of their caregivers. LoRa is a proprietary wireless transmission protocol optimized for long-range, low-power, low-data-rate applications. LoRaWAN is an open stack built upon LoRa.
   Objective: This paper describes an infrastructure designed and experimentally developed to support IoT deployment in a health care setup, and the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia has been chosen for a proof-of-concept study. The peculiarity of the proposed approach is that it is based on the LoRaWAN protocol stack, which exploits unlicensed frequencies and allows for the use of very low-power radio devices, making it a rational choice for IoT communication.
   Methods: A complete LoRaWAN-based infrastructure was designed, with features partly decided in agreement with caregivers, including outdoor patient tracking to control wandering; fall recognition; and capability of collecting data for further clinical studies. Further features suggested by caregivers were night motion surveillance and indoor tracking for large residential structures. Implementation involved a prototype node with tracking and fall recognition capabilities, a middle layer based on an existing network server, and a Web application for overall management of patients and caregivers. Tests were performed to investigate indoor and outdoor capabilities in a real-world setting and study the applicability of LoRaWAN in health and social care scenarios.
   Results: Three experiments were carried out. One aimed to test the technical functionality of the infrastructure, another assessed indoor features, and the last assessed outdoor features. The only critical issue was fall recognition, because a slip was not always easy to recognize.
   Conclusions: The project allowed the identification of some advantages and restrictions of the LoRaWAN technology when applied to the health and social care sectors. Free installation allows the development of services that reach ranges comparable to those available with cellular telephony, but without running costs like telephony fees. However, there are technological limitations, which restrict the scenarios in which LoRaWAN is applicable, although there is room for many applications. We believe that setting up low-weight infrastructure and carefully determining whether applications can be concretely implemented within LoRaWAN limits might help in optimizing community care activities while not adding much burden and cost in information technology management.

AB Background: In the age of aging, Korea's current medical delivery system threatens to increase the number of medical and caring refugees. This study attempts to develop an integrated senior citizen-oriented healthcare service system in which daily care, professional care, and rehabilitation are organically organized between medical institutions and local communities, thereby meeting the daily life needs of the elderly and inducing well-being, wellness, and well-dying.
   Methods: To develop the integrated healthcare system, data collection and analyses were conducted through a systematic review, literature review, benchmarking, focus group interviews, and expert consultation.
   Results: The senior-specific, citizen-oriented healthcare service system developed in this study is designed to screen patients aged 65 or older within 24 h of being admitted, using the Geriatric Screening for Care-10. If there is reason for concern as a result of the screening, further evaluation is performed through assessment. Doctors and nurses create a care plan and a discharge plan based on the results from the screening and assessment. The nurse further uses the screening to monitor the patient's condition before discharge. Based on the screening results at the time of discharge, a transitional care plan is prepared and provided to elderly patients and/or their families. This process enables a systematic link between medical institutions and community resources, aiming for the continuous management of health issues. It also establishes a multidisciplinary treatment plan that considers patients and their families so that diseases common to the elderly are diagnosed and treated promptly.
   Conclusions: The most important issue for the elderly is to be able to live healthily and independently for the rest of their lives through well-being, wellness, and well-dying. The senior-specific, citizen-oriented healthcare service proposed in this study is an integrated medical treatment system for elderly users the implementation of which requires the daily care, professional care, and rehabilitation of elderly members of society to be organically organized according to the role of the patients, their families, and the caregiver.

AB Information regarding individual needs of older adults with intellectual disabilities (IDs) is scarce although it is very important both from a person-centered planning perspective and from a proactive service system perspective. This study has three main aims: (1) to identify and describe staff perceptions of the needs of a large group of adults aged 45 or over with IDs; (2) to analyze the perceived needs as function of age, gender, and level of disability; (3) to present information about the development and the psychometric properties of the assessment instrument used. The participants were 232 Portuguese older adults with IDs (mean age = 52), predominantly male (n = 129). There were 66 staff members who assessed the needs of the IDs participants through the Inventory of Identification of Needs (IIN). The IIN demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties (e.g., internal consistency, interrater reliability, construct validity). The unmet needs were numerous and diverse, but those that were perceived as more prevalent were: literacy, handling of money, information on rights, self-care, information on services, communication, occupation at holidays, occupation at weekends, general physical health, cognitive rehabilitation, and daytime activities. The needs were influenced by the disability level: regarding Literacy/Information and Occupation/Community, needs were significantly more common in persons with a moderate and/or severe disability. The influence of age was registered only in Mental Health. The needs identified should guide the planning and development of service provision. These should offer literacy learning experiences, information about the rights of persons with disabilities, information about the services available, self-care assistance or training in self-care skills; and meaningful activities during regular time periods, weekends and holidays.

AB Objectives To use Population Health Management (PHM) methods to identify and characterise individuals at high-risk of severe COVID-19 for which shielding is required, for the purposes of managing ongoing health needs and mitigating potential shielding-induced harm. Design Individuals at 'high risk' of COVID-19 were identified using the published national 'Shielded Patient List' criteria. Individual-level information, including current chronic conditions, historical healthcare utilisation and demographic and socioeconomic status, was used for descriptive analyses of this group using PHM methods. Segmentation used k-prototypes cluster analysis. Setting A major healthcare system in the South West of England, for which linked primary, secondary, community and mental health data are available in a system-wide dataset. The study was performed at a time considered to be relatively early in the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Participants 1 013 940 individuals from 78 contributing general practices. Results Compared with the groups considered at 'low' and 'moderate' risk (ie, eligible for the annual influenza vaccination), individuals at high risk were older (median age: 68 years (IQR: 55-77 years), cf 30 years (18-44 years) and 63 years (38-73 years), respectively), with more primary care/community contacts in the previous year (median contacts: 5 (2-10), cf 0 (0-2) and 2 (0-5)) and had a higher burden of comorbidity (median Charlson Score: 4 (3-6), cf 0 (0-0) and 2 (1-4)). Geospatial analyses revealed that 3.3% of rural and semi-rural residents were in the high-risk group compared with 2.91% of urban and inner-city residents (p<0.001). Segmentation uncovered six distinct clusters comprising the high-risk population, with key differentiation based on age and the presence of cancer, respiratory, and mental health conditions. Conclusions PHM methods are useful in characterising the needs of individuals requiring shielding. Segmentation of the high-risk population identified groups with distinct characteristics that may benefit from a more tailored response from health and care providers and policy-makers.

DE Big data technology; grassroots community; management of elderly
   patients with chronic conditions; application value
AB Objective: We aimed to investigate the application value of big data technology in community-based integrated medical and elder care for elderly patients with chronic diseases. Methods: Big data technology was introduced on October 2018 for integrated medical treatment and elderly patient care in the community, and a comparative analysis was conducted between 2017 and 2018. Results: The incidence rates of name error and quantity error in the data management in 2017 were higher than those in 2018 (both P<0.001), and the incidence of untimely data entry (data entry that was too early or too late) was also higher in 2017 than in 2018 (both P<0.01). Conclusion: The application of big data technology in community-based integrated medical treatment and elderly patients care with chronic conditions can markedly increase the management efficiency and improve the care of senior patients service. Also, this technology can help to reduce the error rate in data management, improve the quality of senior patient rehabilitation and healthcare as well as home-based smart services, and reduce the incidence of potential adverse events throughout the whole process of this integrated care in a significant way.

AB Objective Older adults are hospitalised from the emergency department (ED) without potentially needing hospital care. Knowledge about rates, associative factors and causes of these preventable emergency admissions (PEAs) is limited. This study aimed to determine the rates, associative factors and causes for PEAs of older adults. Design A mixed-method observational study. Setting The EDs of two Dutch hospitals. Participants 492 patients aged >70 years and hospitalised from the ED. Measurements Quantitative data were retrospectively extracted from the electronical medical record over a 1-month period. Admissions were classified (non)preventable based on a standardised approach. Univariate and multivariate multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed to identify possible associations between PEAs and demographic, clinical and care process factors. Qualitative data were prospectively collected by email and telephone interviews and analysed thematically to explore hospital physician's perceived causes for the identified PEAs. Results Of the 492 included cases, 86 (17.5%) were classified as PEA. Patients with a higher age (adjusted OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08; p=0.04), a low urgency classification (adjusted OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.15; p=0.01), and attending the ED in the weekend (adjusted OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.37; p<0.01) were associated with an increased likelihood of a PEA. 49 physicians were interviewed by telephone and email. Perceived causes for PEAs were related to patient's attitudes (eg, postponement of medical care at home), provider's attitudes (eg, deciding for admission after family pressure), health system deficiencies (eg, limited access to community services during out-of-hours and delayed access to inpatient diagnostic resources) and poor communication between primary care and hospital professionals about patient treatment preferences. Conclusions Our findings contribute to existing evidence that many emergency admissions of older adults are preventable, thereby indicating a possible source of unnecessary expensive, and potentially harmful, hospital care.

AB Informed by Donabedian's quality-of-care framework, this study aims to examine elderly clients' service satisfaction and service recommendation for community-based meal services in Shanghai. We analyzed secondary survey data from randomly sampled elderly clients of a community-based meal service in the old Jing'an District in Shanghai (N= 690). Quality of food and caregivers' attitudes were key to respondents' service recommendation while tidiness of tableware and interactions with caregivers were positively related to their service satisfaction. Overlaps and differences between structure and process factors are discussed. We also provide tailored policy recommendations.

AB Objective: Recognizing frailty, also known as clinical geriatric syndrome in the elderly that is characterized by high vulnerability and low resilience, and its extensive influence in clinical practice is challenging. This study aims to develop a social frailty prediction system based on machine learning approaches in order to identify the social frailty status of the elders in order to advance appropriate social services provision.
   Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled and collected information from 595 community-dwelling seniors aged 65+. Fourteen predictors established from questionnaires and electronic medical records were used to predict the social frailty of participants. Bagged classification and regression trees, model average neural network, random forest, C5.0, eXtreme gradient boosting, and stochastic gradient boosting were used to build the predictive model in use. Performance was compared using accuracy, kappa, area under receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. The frailty predictive system was web-based and built upon representational state transfer application program interfaces.
   Results: C5.0 achieved the best overall performance than remaining learners, and was adopted as the base learner for the social frailty prediction system. In terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), health literacy (AUC=0.68) was found to be the most important variable for predicting one's social frailty, followed by comorbidity (AUC=0.67), religious participation (AUC=0.67), physical activity (AUC=0.66), and geriatric depression score (AUC=0.62).
   Conclusions: Results suggest that a combination of such data that is both available and unavailable from electronic medical records is predictive of the social frailty of an elderly population.

AB Dementia among elderly is a serious problem worldwide. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and associated risk factors of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in nursing homes (NHs) and common communities (CCs) among elderly in China.
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 4 communities across 12 cities in Southern China from May to November of 2014. Qualified psychiatrists and trained nurses carried out relevant diagnosis, assessments, interviews, and information collection. Screening test of mini-mental state examination was conducted among participants firstly, then confirmed diagnosis was carried out among the ones with positive results. Student t test, chi test, univariate, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted to analyze data.
   A total of 2015 participants aged 65 or older were included in the final analysis; 908 came from NHs while 1107 came from CCs. The crude prevalence rates of dementia and MCI were 22.0% and 15.8%, respectively among all the participants. Dementia prevalence was 42.4% among those living in NHs, which was significantly higher than that of 5.3% in CCs (P<.0001). There were more moderate and severe dementia in NHs compared with CCs (P<.0001). It showed that older age, illiterate compared with high level of education (adjusted odds ratio, AOR=3.32, 95% CI: 1.53-7.21), heavy drinking (AOR=1.51 (1.00-2.24), having a medical history of diabetes (AOR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.02-2.33), and stroke (AOR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.23) were associated with dementia in NHs, and middle socioeconomic status might be a protective factor for dementia (AOR=0.33, 95% CI: 0.21-0.51).
   The problem of senile dementia in NHs is much more serious than our estimation, and there are not enough trained nursing staffs in NHs. More population-based strategies in NHs, including conducting cognitive screening accompanied with routine physical examination among elderly population, carrying out related primary prevention policies and public health services, and paying attention to some modifiable associated risk factors such as heavy smoking and drinking are needed.

AB The prevailing digital divide along with barriers to information communication technology (ICT) adoption among older adults is well elucidated. To contribute evidence on ICT education, a 2-year randomized controlled trial verified the long-term effect of a novel individualized ICT training program for older adults in demographic cohorts who are known to underutilize ICT (n = 42 in the training and n = 43 in a control group). Mixed-model repeated measures analysis of data was conducted from baseline and 6-month intervals (df = 4, 1) post training. Older adults in the training group engaged in a wide range of leisure (p =.03), health management (p =.006), and instrumental activities of daily living (p =.02) significantly more than those in the control group. They also reported significantly enhanced technology acceptance and sustained sense of independence in key ICT-based activities. The study supports the implementation of one-on-one ICT training programs to promote access and utilization of digital resources for aging-in-place.

AB Objectives Nursing staff in residential aged care facilities (RACF)s often make decisions about the transfer of residents to the emergency department (ED). This paper describes the protocol of a study that aims to understand decision-making process utilised by RACF registered nurses (RNs) and to explore the perceptions of RNs about the decision and communication process between RACF and ED. Methods The proposed mixed-method study will survey and interview RACF RNs to understand their decision to transfer a resident and collect information about older people referred to the ED. Data collection will involve telephone survey, ED information system (EDIS) data and semistructured interviews. Results The project outcomes will provide an understanding of existing ED service provision, communication between facilities and the reasons for transfer of older person to ED. This may inform redesign in communication processes between the ED and local RACFs and outreach care from the ED to RACFs.

AB Arthritis is one of the most common chronic conditions in aging adults, with both physical and mental health issues and consequences. However, there is insufficient arthritis research among aging adults with serious mental illness (SMI). This study examined rates of doctor-diagnosed arthritis and its cross-sectional associations with self-reported physical health function among adults aged 50 years and older with SMI. Community-based mental health center participants (n = 176) reported clinical and sociodemographic data (e.g., physical health function, sex), whereas diagnostic information (i.e., arthritis, psychiatric, and medical diagnoses) was retrieved from medical records. Arthritis prevalence was high (43.8%) and had an independent, negative association with physical health function. Findings suggest that arthritis evaluations and intervention services need to be prioritized in middle-aged and older adults with SMI. Future research should focus on further testing arthritis self-management programs and other nonpharmacological psychosocial approaches for arthritis in aging adults with SMI.

AB Background > Little is known regarding healthcare for cancer patients treated mainly at home during the month before they die. The aim of this study was to provide information on how they were treated and what were their causes of death.
   Methods > This population-based observational study analysing information obtained from the French national healthcare data system (SNDS) included adult health insurance beneficiaries treated for cancer who died in 2015 after having spent at least 25 of their last 30 days at home.
   Results > Among the cancer patients who died in 2015, 25,463 (20%) were included [mean age (+/- SD) 74 +/- 13.2 years, men 62%]; 54% of them died at home. They were slightly older (75 vs. 73 years) than those who died in hospital, had less frequently received hospital palliative care during the year preceding their deaths (19% vs. 41%) and had less often used medical transport (41% vs. 73%) to an emergency department (8% vs. 62%), to hospital-based (11% vs. 17%) or community-based (16% vs. 12%) chemotherapy, to a general practitioner (73% vs. 78%) or to a community-based nursing service (63% vs. 73%). However, when they consulted a general practitioner (median 3 visits vs. 2) or a nurse (median 22 nursing procedures vs. 10) during their last month of life, visits were more frequent. The leading cause of death was tumour, which represented 69% of deaths at home vs. 74% of deaths in hospital.
   Conclusions > In France, home management during the last month of life is uncommon and even when it is occurs, in one out of two cases patients pass away in a hospital setting. This study is an interrogation on medical choices, given the wish of many of the French to die at home and placing their choices in an international perspective.

AB Objectives: Few studies have explored the lived experiences of chronic cognitive and mood symptoms following stroke using a racially/ethnically diverse sample. Therefore, we aimed to explore the perceptions of chronic post-stroke cognition and mood symptoms and goals among a racially/ethnically diverse sample of community-dwelling adults aging with stroke. Method: This qualitative study using mixed-methods analysis included semi-structured interviews regarding perceived post-stroke cognitive and mood symptoms among community-dwelling stroke survivors at least one-year post stroke. Transcripts were subjected to thematic content analysis, and differences in theme usage patterns by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and post-acute rehabilitation setting were assessed using an inferential clustering technique. Results: The majority of participants (93%) reported cognition-related themes, including language and communication, memory, thinking abilities, comprehension, visual-spatial processing, and cognitive assessments and training. Nearly half of participants mentioned mood-related themes, including depression, aggression and anger, mood fluctuations, anxiety, and psychological services and medication. Nearly half reported an unmet need for cognition or mood-related treatment. Inferential clustering analysis revealed that older participants reported a different pattern of cognitive and mood symptoms than those aged younger than 65 (p = 0.02). Older adults were more likely to describe post-stroke language/communication changes, while younger adults described post-stroke mood changes. Conclusion: Stroke survivors experienced cognitive and mood-related symptoms beyond one-year post stroke, which has implications for long-term assessment and management. Incorporation of continued symptom monitoring into existing community-based services is needed to address chronic cognitive and mood symptoms affecting the quality of life of persons with stroke.

AB User satisfaction is a crucial quality indicator in health service provision. Few studies have measured user satisfaction among homeless and formerly homeless individuals, despite the high prevalence of mental health disorders (MHD) in this population. The purpose of this study was to assess overall satisfaction among 455 homeless and formerly homeless individuals who were receiving health and community services, and to identify factors associated with user satisfaction. Data collection occurred between January and September 2017. Study participants were 18 years old or over, with experience of homelessness in the current or recent past. They completed a questionnaire eliciting socio-demographic information, and data on residential history, service use and satisfaction and health profiles. Multivariate linear analysis was performed on overall satisfaction with health and community services in the previous 12 months. Independent variables were organised as predisposing, enabling and needs factors based on the Gelberg-Andersen Behavioral Model. The mean satisfaction score was 4.11 (minimum: 1; maximum: 5). Variables associated with greater user satisfaction included: older age, residence in permanent housing, common MHD (e.g., depression, anxiety), having a family physician, having a case manager, strong social network, good quality of life and, marginally, male sex and having substance use disorders (SUD). By contrast, frequent users of public ambulatory health services were the most dissatisfied. User satisfaction was more strongly associated with enabling factors. Strategies for improving satisfaction include: promoting more tailored primary care programmes (including family physician) adapted to the needs of this population, better integrating primary care with specialised services including SUD integrated treatment and enhancing continuity of care through the reinforcement of case management services. Further efforts aimed at increasing access to permanent housing with supports, and eliciting more active involvement by relatives and friends may also improve user satisfaction with services, and reduce unnecessary service use.

AB Background As the incidence and prevalence rates of end stage renal disease (ESRD) rise globally, a disproportionate increase has been observed in the elderly population. Singapore has the fifth highest incidence of treated ESRD worldwide, with the upward trend of ESRD being most apparent among those aged 70 years and older. Although it is well-documented that ESRD patients suffer an impaired quality of life compared to the general population, there is limited research focusing on the unique experiences and needs of elderly ESRD patients in Asian populations. To address the knowledge gap, this study seeks to explore the impact of ESRD and dialysis on the quality of life of elderly (>= 70 years old) ESRD patients in Singapore and examine the coping strategies utilised by these patients. Methods This qualitative study involved semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 7 peritoneal dialysis patients, 5 haemodialysis patients, 4 patients on non-dialysis supportive care and 7 caregivers in Singapore. Interviews were conducted in English, Chinese, and Malay and fully transcribed. QSR NVivo 11 software was used for analysis. Results Participants reported that ESRD and dialysis had an impact on three highly interconnected areas of their quality of life: (a) biological/physical (general symptoms, neuromuscular problems, skin problems and poor sleep quality); (b) psychological (depressive symptoms, anxiety and fears, stress and negative self-perceptions); and (c) social (increased dependence on family and loss of social life). There were four key strategies that participants used to cope with these biopsychosocial challenges: (a) family support (financial, practical and emotional support); (b) religious/spiritual support (experiencing gratitude/contentment, the power of prayer and belonging to a faith community); (c) avoidance (cognitive avoidance and distraction techniques); and (d) acceptance (positive thinking and problem solving). Conclusions This study has provided insights into the biopsychosocial impact of ESRD and dialysis, as well as cultural and religious factors that shape the experiences and coping mechanisms of elderly ESRD patients and caregivers in Singapore, which can be used to further the development and implementation of more holistic and person-centred services to help each patient achieve a better quality of life.

AB This case study explored how a researcher-community partnership contributed to program adaptations when implementing person-centered group-based health promotion services to older people who have migrated to Sweden. The study was conducted over 3 years and various data sources were used: focus groups, individual interviews, documents, and archive material. Findings from different data sources and partners' perspectives were triangulated to an overall case description using an iterative process. Adaptations were shaped through a dynamic process, negotiating toward suitable solutions that culminated in actions taken to adapt or inhibit adaptations. The negotiations were driven by the interplay within and between three reasons to adapt. The partners' opportunities to influence the negotiation process depended on establishing common ground to shape adaptations. Practical implications are provided on how to move from knowledge to action when implementing person-centered group-based health promotion to support optimal aging in the context of migration.

AB OBJECTIVES Barriers to treatment for depression and anxiety are prevalent among older adults and caregivers living in the community. We designed and implemented an evidence-based psychotherapy program to reduce obstacles to care. DESIGN A practice improvement initiative providing no-fee evidence-based mental health care at home in clients' primary languages. SETTING Independence at Home, a community service of SCAN Health Plan in Southern California. PARTICIPANTS Diverse older adults and adult caregivers of older people with age-related disability (mainly dementia). INTERVENTION Redesign of an existing supportive counseling program to improve access to validated models of psychotherapy for depression and anxiety. MEASUREMENTS We describe program content, phases of development, equity in participation from referral to program completion, clinical outcomes, and estimated direct program delivery costs. RESULTS Insights successfully served demographically diverse clients experiencing a broad range of barriers to mental health care. A total of 211 clients completed therapy using one of three evidence-based approaches in the first 33 months of operation (2015-2018). Clinical efficacy was high and equivalent across demographic groups and therapy models. Depression, anxiety, quality of life, self-rated disability, and patient activation all improved significantly. We supported therapists' transition to the new model, modified workflows, and used clinical outcome data and therapist focus groups to improve referral, selection, and enrollment processes and simplify treatment assignment. With program maturation, treatment duration and direct costs both declined. CONCLUSION The Insights model could add value to healthcare organizations seeking to provide effective, equitable mental health services for older adults and caregivers who have difficulty accessing care for depression, anxiety, or difficult life challenges.

AB BackgroundCoordination of care, especially after a patient experiences an acute care event, is a challenge for many health systems. Event notification is a form of health information exchange (HIE) which has the potential to support care coordination by alerting primary care providers when a patient experiences an acute care event. While promising, there exists little evidence on the impact of event notification in support of reengagement into primary care. The objectives of this study are to 1) examine the effectiveness of event notification on health outcomes for older adults who experience acute care events, and 2) compare approaches to how providers respond to event notifications.MethodsIn a cluster randomized trial conducted across two medical centers within the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system, we plan to enroll older patients (>= 65years of age) who utilize both VHA and non-VHA providers. Patients will be enrolled into one of three arms: 1) usual care; 2) event notifications only; or 3) event notifications plus a care transitions intervention. In the event notification arms, following a non-VHA acute care encounter, an HIE-based intervention will send an event notification to VHA providers. Patients in the event notification plus care transitions arm will also receive 30days of care transition support from a social worker. The primary outcome measure is 90-day readmission rate. Secondary outcomes will be high risk medication discrepancies as well as care transitions processes within the VHA health system. Qualitative assessments of the intervention will inform VHA system-wide implementation.DiscussionWhile HIE has been evaluated in other contexts, little evidence exists on HIE-enabled event notification interventions. Furthermore, this trial offers the opportunity to examine the use of event notifications that trigger a care transitions intervention to further support coordination of care.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT02689076.

AB Background: People with Parkinson's disease are twice as likely to experience a fall as a healthy older person, often leading to debilitating effects on confidence, activity levels and quality of life.
   Objective: To estimate the effect of a physiotherapy programme for fall prevention among people with Parkinson's disease.
   Design: A multicentre, pragmatic, investigator-masked, individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) with prespecified subgroup analyses.
   Setting: Recruitment from NHS hospitals and clinics and community and social services in eight English regions with home-based interventions.
   Participants: A total of 474 people with Parkinson's disease (i.e. Hoehn and Yahr scale stages 1-4) were recruited: 238 were assigned to a physiotherapy programme and 236 were assigned to usual care. Random allocation was 50 : 50.
   Intervention: All participants received routine care; the usual-care group received an information digital versatile disc (DVD) and a single advice session at trial completion. The intervention group had an individually tailored, progressive, home-based fall avoidance strategy training programme with balance and strengthening exercises: PDSAFE.
   Main outcome measure: The primary outcome was the risk of repeat falling, collected by self-report monthly diaries between 0 and 6 months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes included near-falls, falls efficacy, freezing of gait (FoG), health-related quality of life, and measurements taken using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest), the Chair Stand Test (CST), the Geriatric Depression Scale, the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire.
   Results: PDSAFE is the largest RCT of falls management among people with Parkinson's disease: 541 patients were screened for eligibility. The average age was 72 years, and 266 out of 474 (56%) participants were men. Of the 474 randomised participants, 238 were randomised to the intervention group and 236 were randomised to the control group. No difference in repeat falling within 6 months of randomisation was found [PDSAFE group to control group odds ratio (OR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.98; p = 0.447]. An analysis of secondary outcomes demonstrated better balance (Mini-BESTest: mean difference 0.95, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.67; p = 0.009), functional strength (CST: p = 0.041) and falls efficacy (Falls Efficacy Scale - International: mean difference 1.6, 95% CI -3.0 to -0.19; p = 0.026) with near-falling significantly reduced with PDSAFE (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; p = 0.001) at 6 months. Prespecified subgroup analysis (i.e. disease severity and FoG) revealed a PDSAFE differing effect; the intervention may be of benefit for people with moderate disease but may increase falling for those in the more severe category, especially those with FoG.
   Limitations: All participants were assessed at primary outcome; only 73% were assessed at 12 months owing to restricted funding.
   Conclusions: PDSAFE was not effective in reducing repeat falling across the range of people with Parkinson's disease in the trial. Secondary analysis demonstrated that other functional tasks and self-efficacy improved and demonstrated differential patterns of intervention impact in accordance with disease severity and FoG, which supports previous secondary research findings and merits further primary evaluation.
   Future work: Further trials of falls prevention on targeted groups of people with Parkinson's disease are recommended.

AB Background: Early identification of knee osteoarthritis (OA) can improve treatment outcomes and reduce medical costs. However, there are major limitations among existing classification or prediction models, including abstract data processing and complicated dataset attributes, which hinder their applications in clinical practice.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to propose a Bayesian network (BN)-based classification model to classify people with knee OA. The proposed model can be treated as a prescreening tool, which can provide decision support for health professionals.
   Methods: The proposed model's structure was based on a 3-level BN structure and then retrained by the Bayesian Search (BS) learning algorithm. The model's parameters were determined by the expectation-maximization algorithm. The used dataset included backgrounds, the target disease, and predictors. The performance of the model was evaluated based on classification accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV); it was also compared with other well-known classification models. A test was also performed to explore whether physical fitness tests could improve the performance of the proposed model.
   Results: A total of 249 elderly people between the ages of 60 and 80 years, living in the Kongjiang community (Shanghai), were recruited from April to September 2007. A total of 157 instances were adopted as the dataset after data preprocessing. The experimental results showed that the results of the proposed model were higher than, or equal to, the mean scores of other classification models: .754 for accuracy, .78 for AUC, .78 for specificity, and .73 for sensitivity. The proposed model provided .45 for PPV and .92 for NPV at the prevalence of 20%. The proposed model also showed a significant improvement when compared with the traditional BN model: 6.3% increase in accuracy (from .709 to .754), 4.0% increase in AUC (from .75 to .78), 6.8% increase in specificity (from .73 to .78), 5.8% increase in sensitivity (from .69 to .73), 15.4% increase in PPV (from .39 to .45), and 2.2% increase in NPV (from .90 to .92). Furthermore, the test results showed that the performance of the proposed model could be largely enhanced through physical fitness tests in 3 evaluation indices: 10.6% increase in accuracy (from .682 to .754), 16.4% increase in AUC (from .67 to .78), and 30.0% increase in specificity (from .60 to .78).
   Conclusions: The proposed model presents a promising method to classify people with knee OA when compared with other classification models and the traditional BN model. It could be implemented in clinical practice as a prescreening tool for knee OA, which would not only improve the quality of health care for elderly people but also reduce overall medical costs.

AB This article describes a senior capstone, Neighborhoods and Health, which used community-based research (CBR) as its primary pedagogy. Students in the course drew upon multiple research methods and forms of data to provide our partner, the Urban Farming Institute of Boston, with an array of research products in support of the revitalization of a historic farm in the Boston neighborhood of Mattapan. Based on pre- and posttest assessment and analysis of students' reflections in their journals, we identify how a multimethods approach-combined with a commitment to producing usable research products-simultaneously contributed to students' research methods proficiency and their understanding of complex social processes. For both sociology departments and interdisciplinary majors that draw on sociological perspectives, CBR offers a compelling means of providing seniors with meaningful capstone experiences while adding capacity to the important work of community-based organizations.

AB Objective Explore how older adults' talk about accessing rural community health services. Methods A qualitative narrative gerontological approach explored issues related to accessing health services in their community. Semi-structured digitally recorded individual interviews were undertaken with 32 community-dwelling older people aged between 75 and 93 years. A narrative data analytic process was undertaken. The COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research guidelines were followed to ensure rigour in this study. Results Three collective narratives resulted from the data analytic process: (a) "accessing local health services"; (b) "accessing specialist services"; and (c) "accessing emergency services." Conclusions Narrators identified a number of issues related to accessing rural health services. These included long waiting times, lack of continuity in care provision by doctors and difficulties accessing specialist and emergency services. Nurses were frequently cited as a reliable point of contact for these older people. Expansion of nursing roles would enhance the provision of rural health-care services.

DE Long-term care (LTC) plan 2; 0; Tier ABC team; Integration mechanisms
AB BackgroundTaiwan, one of the fastest-aging countries in the world, started implementing version 1.0 of its long-term care (LTC) plan in 2008. In 2017, LTC Plan 2.0 began a new era with its goal to integrate Taiwan's fragmented LTC service system. LTC Plan 2.0 also aims to establish an integrated community-based LTC system incorporating both health care and disability prevention. This three-tier model consists of the following: two LTC services with a day-care center as their base and case management (Tier A), a day-care center and a single LTC service (Tier B), and LTC stations that provide primary prevention services and respite services for frail community-dwelling older adults to prevent further disabilities (Tier C). A defined cluster of agencies in a local area works together as a Tier ABC team. LTC Plan 2.0 is a new policy for Taiwan, and hence it is important to understand the agencies' initial difficulties with implementation and identify future challenges to help further policy development.MethodsThis preliminary study explored the challenges to implementing LTC 2.0 through in-depth interviews based on Evashwick's integration mechanisms with representatives from three service teams. We interviewed three chief executive officers and three case managers.ResultsWe found that the LTC Plan 2.0 mechanisms for service integration have been insufficiently implemented. Recommendations include (1) Build up the trust between agencies and government, avoid duplication of LTC services within Tier ABC team, and encourage agencies within a team to create a shared administrative system with the same mission and vision. (2) Clarify the roles and responsibilities of government care managers and agency case managers. (3) Provide an integrated information system and create an official platform for sharing client records across different agencies and caregivers. (4) Establish a tool and platform to track the budget and payment across different levels of service as soon as possible.ConclusionThere is an increased demand for LTC services in Taiwan because of its rapidly aging population. Our findings shed some light on the challenges to developing integrated LTC services and thus may help both policymakers and service providers find ways to overcome these challenges.

AB The advance of medical technology and the enhancement of national life expectancy in past years result in increasing solitary elders and weakening care function of family due to aging, low birth rate, and family structure change. Aiming at the elderly, the provision of telehealth care service has become primary. The development of personal health management systems for seniors is also gradually emphasized. The combination of health care with web-based artificial intelligence and information technology could effectively enhance the quality of telecare and save medical resources for reasonable distribution and full application to enhance the effective self-health management of seniors, reduce the outpatient visits, and save the outpatient time as well as avoid the expenditure for medical resources. Aiming at seniors and people who have to take care of seniors in Shanghai for the questionnaire survey, total 500 copies of questionnaire are distributed, and 357 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 71%. The research results are concluded as below: (1). "Information quality" is the most emphasized dimension, followed by "management service" and "system quality"; (2). Top 5 indicators, among 14 evaluation indicators, are sequenced timeliness, notification of abnormality, reaction time, correctness, and monitoring operation. Finally, suggestions are proposed according to the results, expecting to enhance the self-health management ability of seniors and have them acquire sound health care.

AB BackgroundConcerns over the creation of advance directives (ADs) and the factors associated with treatment directive decisions among Korean community-dwelling older people with chronic diseases have rarely been addressed.
   ObjectivesThis study aimed to examine knowledge, attitudes and barriers/benefits regarding ADs and their associations with AD treatment preferences among chronically ill, low-income, community-dwelling older people.
   MethodsUsing a descriptive, correlational design, older people who were recipients of home visiting service for chronic disease management participated in this study. Home visiting nurses collected data on knowledge, attitudes and perceived barriers/benefits and treatment directives using questionnaires during home visits.
   ResultsOlder people (N=112, mean age=74.9years, women=83.9%) who had chronic diseases such as hypertension (56.3%), diabetes mellitus (40.2%) and cardiovascular disease/stroke (22.3%) participated. Approximately half of the participants preferred hospice care (54.5%), while a few of them preferred aggressive treatments: cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (14.3%), ventilation support (9.8%) and haemodialysis (8.9%). Being married was associated with the likelihood of preferring CPR (odds ratio [OR]=11.79) and ventilation support (OR=9.99), higher education with CPR (OR=1.23) and haemodialysis (OR=1.16), and having a cardiovascular disease (CVD)/stroke with CPR (OR=6.46) and hospice care (OR=3.06). Among the modifiable factors, greater perceived barriers increased the likelihood of CPR preference (OR=1.12) but decreased the likelihood of hospice care preference (OR=0.96). Greater perceived benefits decreased the likelihood of CPR preference (OR=0.81) and ventilation support (OR=0.89), and AD knowledge decreased the likelihood of haemodialysis preference (OR=0.23).
   ConclusionThe multidimensional factors were differently associated with each of the AD treatment preferences. Modifiable factors, including perceived barriers and benefits and knowledge, should be improved to help low-income, community-dwelling older people select adequate AD treatment preferences.
   Implications for practiceAdditional information regarding AD treatments and some modifiable and non-modifiable correlates can be integrated into primary and palliative/supportive care in public health. The current home visitation service may also benefit from incorporating AD discussions while extending the service to embrace AD issues in addition to disease management.

AB Background and Objectives: Although older Hispanics experience high rates of depression, they tend to underuse mental health services. The study examined the association between county characteristics and mental health service use among older Hispanics, controlling for individual characteristics.
   Research Design and Methods: The study used the 2008-2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Study and linked county-level data from the 2013-2014 Area Health Resources Files and the 2008-2012 Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse, using the Federal Information Processing Standard county code. The sample includes 1,143 community-dwelling Hispanics ages 60 years or older (Level 1) and 156 counties (Level 2) where the sample resides. The single dichotomous measure of mental health service utilization was based on whether or not the respondent met one or more of three conditions: (1) the respondent received care from a mental health professional, (2) received a service including mental health counseling or psychotherapy, or (3) received a service that was related to the International Classification of Diseases. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to examine the role of county context.
   Results: The proportion of older adults and the existence of community mental health centers at the county-level were associated with mental health services use among this population. At the individual-level, education and mental health status were also associated with using mental health services.
   Discussion and Implications: The county context plays an important role in understanding mental health services use among older Hispanics, indicating the need for intervention strategies at the county level.

AB Background: An intervention 'Better Oral Health in Home Care' was introduced (2012-2014) to improve the oral health of older people receiving community aged care services. Implementation of the intervention was theoretically framed by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework. Process outcomes demonstrated significant improvements in older people's oral health.
   Objective: To evaluate the extent to which the intervention has been embedded and sustained into routine community aged care practice 3 years after the initial implementation project.
   Design: A Realist Evaluation applying Normalisation Process Theory within a single case study setting.
   Setting: Community aged care (home care) provider in South Australia, Australia.
   Participants: Purposeful sampling was undertaken. Twelve staff members were recruited from corporate, management and direct care positions. Two consumers representing high and low care recipients also participated.
   Methods: Qualitative methods were applied in two subcases, reflecting different contextual settings. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and analysed deductively by applying the Normalisation Process Theory core constructs (with the recommended phases of the Realist Evaluation cycle). Retrospective and prospective analytic methods investigated how the intervention has been operationalised by comparing two timeframes: Time 1 (Implementation June 2012-December 2014) and Time 2 (Post-implementation July 2017-July 2018).
   Results: At Time 1, the initial program theory proposed that multi-level facilitation contributed to a favourable context that triggered positive mechanisms supportive of building organisational and workforce oral healthcare capacity. At Time 2, an alternative program theory of how the intervention has unfolded in practice described a changed context following the withdrawal of the project facilitation processes with the triggering of alternative mechanisms that have made it difficult for staff to embed sustainable practice.
   Conclusion: Findings concur with the literature that successful implementation outcomes do not necessarily guarantee sustainability. The study has provided a deeper explanation of how contextual characteristics have contributed to the conceptualisation of oral healthcare as a low priority, basic work ready personal care task and how this, in turn, hindered the embedding of sustainable oral healthcare into routine community aged care practice. This understanding can be used to better inform the development of strategies, such as multi-level facilitation, needed to navigate contextual barriers so that sustainable practice can be achieved.

AB Objectives The aim of the study was to understand the experiences of living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) from the perspective of community-living older adults with MCC.
   Design A qualitative study using an interpretive description approach.
   Setting Participants were recruited from southern Ontario, Canada.
   Participants 21 community-living, older adults (>= 65 years) with an average of 7.4 chronic conditions including one of diabetes, dementia or stroke.
   Methods Data were collected through digitally-recorded, in-depth, semi-structured in-person interviews. Interview transcripts were analysed and coded using Thorne's interpretive description approach.
   Results Five themes were identified representing older adults' experiences of living with MCC: (a) trying to stay healthy while living with MCC, (b) depending on family caregivers for support with just about everything, (c) paying the high costs of living with MCC, (d) making healthcare decisions by proxy and (e) receiving healthcare services that do not address the complex needs of persons living with MCC.
   Conclusions The experience of living with MCC in the community was complex and multi-faceted. The need for a person-centred and family-centred approach to care in the community, which includes the coordination of health and social services that are tailored to the needs of older adults and their informal caregivers, was underscored. Such an approach would facilitate improved information-sharing and discussion of care management options between health professionals and their patients, enable older adults with MCC to actively engage in priority-setting and decision-making and may result in improved health and quality of life for older adults with MCC.

AB Custodial grandparenting can be especially challenging for older grandmothers facing age specific issues. Kinship navigator programs are social service delivery programs intended to inform grandparents and other relatives raising children about available resources and services, provide information specific to their individual needs, and help families navigate service systems. Our study utilizes self-report data from one kinship navigator federal demonstration project, which used a randomized control trial, to examine demographic characteristics for grandmothers under and over 55 years of age, whether grandmother caregivers (>= 55 years) improve family resilience, social support, and caregiver self-efficacy, and which interventions improved outcomes for grandmothers (>= 55 years). Each participant was randomly assigned to one of four groups: Usual Care (traditional child welfare services), Standard Care (family support and case management), Peer-to-Peer Care Only, and Full Kin Tech Care (peer navigators with computer access and interdisciplinary team). Thirty-nine percent of grandmothers (55-75 years) were mostly living in poverty, predominantly Caucasian, with 36% identifying as African American/Black, with at least one to two children at home. Repeated-measures ANOVAs for each subscale showed statistically significant within- and between-group differences for Family Functioning, Social Supports, Concrete Supports, Child Development, and Nurturing and Attachment, with the exception of Usual Care, which showed a decline in protective factors consistently across subscales. Future research with kinship families could qualitatively examine the experiences for older women in navigator programs and replication of kinship navigator programs could build capacity in data collection and maintenance systems to gain better perspective about how systems of care impact families.

AB Introduction Cognitive training is an emerging non-pharmacological treatment to improve cognitive and physical function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abnormal brain blood flow is a key process in the development of cognitive decline. However, no studies have explored the effects of cognitive training on brain blood flow in dementia. The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility for a large-scale, randomised controlled trial of cognitive training in healthy older adults (HC), MCI and early AD.
   Methods and analysis This study will recruit 60 participants, in three subgroups of 20 (MCI, HC, AD), from primary, secondary and community services. Participants will be randomised to a 12-week computerised cognitive training programme (five x 30 min sessions per week), or waiting-list control. Participants will undergo baseline and follow-up assessments of: mood, cognition, quality of life and activities of daily living. Cerebral blood flow will be measured at rest and during task activation (pretraining and post-training) by bilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, alongside heart rate (3-lead ECG), end-tidal CO2 (capnography) and beat-to-beat blood pressure (Finometer). Participants will be offered to join a focus group or semistructured interview to explore barriers and facilitators to cognitive training in patients with dementia. Qualitative data will be analysed using framework analysis, and data will be integrated using mixed methods matrices.
   Ethics and dissemination Bradford Leeds Research Ethics committee awarded a favourable opinion (18/YH/0396). Results of the study will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and presented at national and international conferences on ageing and dementia.

TI Diagnostic tests, drug prescriptions, and follow-up patterns after
   incident heart failure: A cohort study of 93,000 UK patients
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID ESC GUIDELINES; CARE; OUTCOMES; TRENDS
AB Background Effective management of heart failure is complex, and ensuring evidence-based practice presents a major challenge to health services worldwide. Over the past decade, the United Kingdom introduced a series of national initiatives to improve evidence-based heart failure management, including a landmark pay-for-performance scheme in primary care and a national audit in secondary care started in 2004 and 2007, respectively. Quality improvement efforts have been evaluated within individual clinical settings, but patterns of care across its continuum, although a critical component of chronic disease management, have not been studied. We have designed this study to investigate patients' trajectories of care around the time of diagnosis and their variation over time by age, sex, and socioeconomic status.
   Methods and findings For this retrospective population-based study, we used linked primary and secondary health records from a representative sample of the UK population provided by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We identified 93,074 individuals newly diagnosed with heart failure between 2002 and 2014, with a mean age of 76.7 years and of which 49% were women. We examined five indicators of care: (i) diagnosis care setting (inpatient or outpatient), (ii) posthospitalisation follow-up in primary care, (iii) diagnostic investigations, (iv) prescription of essential drugs, and (v) drug treatment dose. We used Poisson and linear regression models to calculate category-specific risk ratios (RRs) or adjusted differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for year of diagnosis, age, sex, region, and socioeconomic status. From 2002 to 2014, indicators of care presented diverging trends. Outpatient diagnoses and follow-up after hospital discharge in primary care declined substantially (ranging from 56% in 2002 to 36% in 2014, RR 0.64 [0.62, 0.67] and 20% to 14%, RR 0.73 [0.65, 0.82], respectively). Primary care referral for diagnostic investigations and appropriate initiation of beta blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) both increased significantly (37% versus 82%, RR 2.24 [2.15, 2.34] and 18% versus 63%, RR 3.48 [2.72, 4.43], respectively). Yet, the average daily dose prescribed remained below guideline recommendations (42% for ACE-Is or ARBs, 29% for beta blockers in 2014) and was largely unchanged beyond the first 30 days after diagnosis. Despite increasing rates of treatment initiation, the overall dose prescribed to patients in the 12 months following diagnosis improved little over the period of study (adjusted difference for the combined dose of beta blocker and ACE-I or ARB: +6% [+2%, +10%]). Women and patients aged over 75 years presented significant gaps across all five indicators of care. Our study was limited by the available clinical information, which did not include exact left ventricular ejection fraction values, investigations performed during hospital admissions, or information about follow-up in community heart failure clinics.
   Conclusions Management of heart failure patients in the UK presents important shortcomings that affect screening, continuity of care, and medication titration and disproportionally impact women and older people. National reporting and incentive schemes confined to individual clinical settings have been insufficient to identify these gaps and address patients' long-term care needs.

AB In homes, problems in daily functioning of older people often occur in the bathroom, especially in the transfers to the toilet and/or shower/bath. Assistive products have the potential to maximise functional independence (i.e. performance without assistance from another person) in everyday activities; however, more research is needed to better understand the impact of this technology on independence in the transfers in the bathroom. Additionally, little is known about the role of the environmental factors in the process of implementing bathroom adaptations. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationship between the use of assistive products and independence in the transfers in the bathroom. The secondary objective was to determine the role of the environmental factors in predicting the implementation of bathroom adaptations. 193 community-dwelling older adults with disabilities in the basic activities of daily life, who requested public long-term care services in Spain, were included. Data was collected in the participant's homes using a standardised assessment procedure. There was no significant association between the number of categories of assistive products used in the toilet transfer and the independent performance of this task. In a multivariate model, the number of categories of assistive products used in the transfer to shower/bath was positively associated with the independent performance of this transfer (OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.48-4.53; p = 0.001). A multivariate analysis revealed that social functioning was significantly associated with the implementation of a bathroom adaptation; social risk was lower in participants who made an adaptation (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.63-0.93; p = 0.006). Assistive products may play an important role in promoting independence in the bathroom. Assistive product needs should be addressed when planning community-based interventions aimed at improving daily life. Moreover, social functioning had a strong influence on the installation of bathroom adaptations, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to social factors in the home adaptations planning process.

AB BackgroundPrimary care access can be challenging for older, rural, socio-economically disadvantaged populations. Here we report the I-ACT cluster feasibility trial which aims to assess the feasibility of trial design and context-sensitive intervention to improve primary care access for this group and so expand existing theory.MethodsFour general practices were recruited; three randomised to intervention and one to usual care. Intervention practices received 1500, a support manual and four meetings to develop local, innovative solutions to improve the booking system and transport.Patients aged over 64years old and without household car access were recruited to complete questionnaires when booking an appointment or attending the surgery. Outcome measures at 6 months included: self-reported ease of booking an appointment and transport; health care use; patient activation; capability; and quality of life. A process evaluation involved observations and interviews with staff and participants.ResultsThirty-four patients were recruited (26 female, eight male, mean age 81.6years for the intervention group and 79.4 for usual care) of 1143 invited (3% response rate). Most were ineligible because of car access. Twenty-nine participants belonged to intervention practices and five to usual care. Practice-level data was available for all participants, but participant self-reported data was unavailable for three. Fifty-six appointment questionnaires were received based on 150 appointments (37.3%).Practices successfully designed and implemented the following context-sensitive interventions: Practice A: a stacked telephone system and promoting community transport; Practice B: signposting to community transport, appointment flexibility, mobility scooter charging point and promoting the role of receptionists; and Practice C: local taxi firm partnership and training receptionists. Practices found the process acceptable because it gave freedom, time and resource to be innovative or provided an opportunity to implement existing ideas. Data collection methods were acceptable to participants, but some found it difficult remembering to complete booking and appointment questionnaires. Expanded theory highlighted important mechanisms, such as reassurance, confidence, trust and flexibility.ConclusionsRecruiting older participants without access to a car proved challenging. Retention of participants and practices was good but only about a third of appointment questionnaires were returned. This study design may facilitate a shift from one-size-fits-all interventions to more context-sensitive interventions.Trial registration p id=Par7 ISRCTN18321951, Registered on 6 March 2017.

AB In the Through their Eyes Project health sciences students are partnered with older adults to explore and assess the age-friendliness of their neighborhood. Using an innovative data collection tool - 'moving interviews' - these intergenerational research teams learn about the community and each other by traveling, observing, and discussing these landscapes together. The research project culminates in a community forum where findings are presented to government officials, the housing association and aging organizations. In addition to completing the research project, students are required to keep a journal to reflect on their experience. The purpose of this study was to explore students experience participating in a critical intergenerational service learning project. Two research questions guided this inquiry: What was the experience for students and, what elements of the project are important to that experience? Student journals collected over 5 years from 191 students comprised the data for this study. Data were analyzed using a 6-phase thematic analysis process. Two key findings related to student experience emerged from the study: increased awareness and prompted to action. Elements of the course found significant to this experience included an aging simulation activity and the specific design of the project. The paper concludes with suggestions for developing and integrating critical service-learning pedagogy into gerontological education.

AB Introduction As a growing number of seniors with complex needs are living at home, the implementation of telecare has become a priority. This article aims to identify factors influencing inter- and intra-organisational collaboration in Norwegian primary care. The focus is on collaboration in service provision for senior users with telecare solutions, in this case personal alarms. Methods Data were collected from two individual interviews with each of seven middle managers from four different units. Additionally, group interviews were conducted during two workshops, both with 16 and 17 front-line staff members from four local authority units. Results Challenges and barriers to collaboration and integration were information flow and information sharing, unclear understanding of the division of duties between the units involved and their employees and the lack of meeting points between the emergency medical centre and home nursing. Interagency meetings between the purchasing office and home nursing enhance collaboration. Conclusion The introduction of telecare does not simplify collaboration or improve services; technology does not solve collaboration challenges. Technology limits information to written form, which may not meet the needs of the service provider and user. Collaboration and integration require common strategies and leadership that implements them, including in telecare.

TI Towards equitable surgical systems: development and outcomes of a

SO BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH

DT Article
ID SURGERY; HEALTH; AFRICA
AB Despite emergency and essential surgery and anaesthesia care being recognised as a part of Universal Health Coverage, 5 billion people worldwide lack access to safe, timely and affordable surgery and anaesthesia care. In Tanzania, 19% of all deaths and 17 % of disability-adjusted life years are attributable to conditions amenable to surgery. It is recommended that countries develop and implement National Surgical, Obstetric and Anesthesia Plans (NSOAPs) to systematically improve quality and access to surgical, obstetric and anaesthesia (SOA) care across six domains of the health system including (1) service delivery, (2) infrastructure, including equipment and supplies, (3) workforce, (4) information management, (5) finance and (6) Governance. This paper describes the NSOAP development, recommendations and lessons learnt from undertaking NSOAP development in Tanzania. The NSOAP development driven by the Ministry of Health Community Development Gender Elderly and Children involved broad consultation with over 200 stakeholders from across government, professional associations, clinicians, ancillary staff, civil society and patient organisations. The NSOAP describes time-bound, costed strategic objectives, outputs, activities and targets to improve each domain of the SOA system. The final NSOAP is ambitious but attainable, reflects on-the-ground priorities, aligns with existing health policy and costs an additional 3% of current healthcare expenditure. Tanzania is the third country to complete such a plan and the first to report on the NSOAP development in such detail. The NSOAP development in Tanzania provides a roadmap for other countries wishing to undertake a similar NSOAP development to strengthen their SOA system.

TI The emerging role of Financial Counsellors in supporting Older Persons
   in financial hardship and with management of Consumer-directed Care
   packages within Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
LA English
DT Article
DE aged care; consumer-directed care; financial counselling;
   financialisation; older persons
AB The role of financial counsellors as providers of information, support and advocacy for those in financial difficulty is a well established mechanism in the mainstream welfare landscape in Australia. In general, the role of financial counsellors is in helping people alleviate or resolve their financial difficulties through improvement of their financial literacy. It is recognised as an important component of policy responses to assist low-income households and individuals in financial stress. The use of financial counsellors for older persons (i.e., those aged 65+ years) however appears to be underutilised. Financial hardship and abuse of older persons within our community are becoming key issues as the population of Australia "ages". Existing evidence also suggests that service providers alone do not have adequate skills to address these issues. This paper firstly examines the development of financial counselling in Australia. It then examines the newly emerging role of financial counselling in supporting older persons in addressing barriers to financial literacy and then in navigating the complex landscape of aged care service provision. The current finacialisation, marketisation and complexities of consumer-directed care are identified as key contextual factors. The paper will then discuss an evaluation study of the provision of financial counselling to the older person population designed to support financial hardship and navigation of the complex aged care services system. The findings of the paper are based on an evaluation of the Financial Consumer Rights Council (FCRC), Victoria: Dignity and Debt Financial Difficulty and Getting Older initiative. This pilot initiative included older persons from both community-based and aged care residential facilities in one regional area of Victoria. The initiative, conducted over 2016, was designed to assess the effectiveness of one-on-one financial counselling sessions with older persons that provided consumer advocacy and information about support services and entitlements (including hardship protections) associated with ageing. The evaluation found that the provision of financial counselling to the older person population could be a key mechanism in improving overall financial literacy, avoiding periods of financial hardship and in maintaining financial well-being, quality of life and positive ageing. Findings also demonstrated a need for an expanded model of outreach financial counselling model to better service older persons in more isolated living environments and/or with mobility impairments living in the community, and the potential to situate offices of financial counsellors within medical centres (a space often visited by the ageing population), to co-situate financial health check-ups as an overall element of health and well-being. As such, financial counselling was viewed as well-placed to support older persons in improvement of financial literacy and in supporting navigation of the increasingly complex marketised and consumer-directed care (CDC) landscape of aged care service provision in Australia.

AB BackgroundThe proportion of older people has dramatically increased in recent decades. Moreover, social and demographic trends show a global increase of older people at risk of loneliness and lack of social relationships. The objective of this study was to evaluate the process, the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of a planned 22 weekly group sessions called School of Health for Older People to reduce social isolation.MethodsThis is a mixed methods multi-approach evaluation that includes: 1) A qualitative evaluation among coordinators and participants taking part in the intervention, through in depth-interviews and focus groups, respectively. The main topics covered will be positive and negative aspects of the intervention, suggestions for its improvement, opinions on different aspects of the intervention, and perceived benefits; 2) A quantitative quasi-experimental design, comparing a group of individuals taking part in the intervention with another group with similar characteristics not receiving the intervention. Data will be collected at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Social support will be measured through questions drawn from the Medical Outcomes Study and the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project questionnaires. Psychological morbidity will be measured through Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire, and Health-related Quality of Life will be measured through the EuroQoL questionnaire. Information on visits to the primary care center in the years before and after the intervention will be obtained from the electronic records of the primary care centers; 3) A cost-utility analysis, which will be conducted from a health system (primary care) perspective, including direct costs of the program and the primary care health services used. The effects of the intervention will be measured on quality-adjusted life years.DiscussionThere is an urgent need for studies assessing the effectiveness and the efficiency of potential interventions to reduce social isolation among older persons. The results of this study will help to fill the knowledge gap in this area and might be especially useful for the development of social and public health policies and programs for older people in disadvantaged neighborhoods in urban areas.Trial registrationNCT03142048 retrospectively registered (April 11, 2017).

AB This article aims to encourage critical reflection about the limitations of the rational choice approach as an explanatory insight to understanding older people's choice-making about their health or social care requirements. It develops an interpretive framework examining how older people engage in the process of choice-making when selecting a care option. Choice-making is conceptualised as a temporal, processual phenomenon, influenced by others, and characterised by an individual's behavioural responses to changing circumstance and lifecourse events. Data are from qualitative interviews with 29 older adults whose choice of care option involved moving to an extra-care setting in Wales (United Kingdom). Transcripts were coded using in-case and constant-comparison approaches, and analysis was undertaken using concepts of engagement and temporality as elements of the choice-making process. Using an inductive approach, a typology of six different pathways to choice' of care setting was identified; these findings suggest that choosing a care option in later life is a diverse, interactive and time-bound social phenomenon, inadequately captured by the rational choice approach where it is understood more as an individualised, linear and logical process. Recognising that choice-making evolves through time as part of a process shaped by others means service providers will be better positioned to offer opportunities for more preventative-focused interventions which empower older consumers to make planned and informed choices about care options.

ID EARTHQUAKE
AB Background: When a disaster occurs older people are recognised to be among one of the vulnerable population groups. During the Great East Japan earthquake in 2011, there were numerous unresolved health and social issues for the survivors.
   Aim of the study: To understand which challenges older people that survived the 2011 disaster faced, which aspects they identified as concerns and what they felt was difficult and possibly could not recover from in the near future.
   Methods: A qualitative case study method was used. Sixteen participants, living in temporary housing, were interviewed in 2015. The interview data was analysed using thematic analysis.
   Findings and discussion: Participants (4 men; 12 women) were aged between 65 and 89 years. Seven participants stated that they were healthy although they had minor health issues. Some women had psycho-social health issues brought about by the trauma they experienced, caring for their aging relatives and living in temporary housing. Four themes emerged: feeling grateful to be alive; issues related to health and mental health; the importance of recreational activities and community involvement; feeling of fear, uncertainty and vulnerability.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to report directly participants' feelings and views after their traumatic experience. All participants were happy to be interviewed and to express their views. Although participants expressed their need for health professional services to be available to support them following traumatic events, these services are yet to be recognised as an essential part of the recovery process.

AB This study aimed to explore how the aging population in Appalachia manages its transportation and plans for the transition to non-driving and to seek possible solutions to the challenge of meeting rural transportation needs. Four focus groups (N = 38) were conducted, supplemented by a questionnaire, in Appalachian Kentucky. The results showed that few alternative transportation existed except a local paratransit service and informal transportation support. Compared to older adults, middle-aged adults reported a greater willingness to use mobile phones and the Internet to arrange transportation if they were available. Participants also recommended expanding the use of existing transportation in the community - such as church vans - to better meet the aging population's needs. The findings suggest that partnership between government, non-profit, and private sectors is needed, not solely focusing on a tax-dependent solution. Additionally, information and communication technology-based transportation management system would help maximize the use of scare but existing resources in rural areas.

AB With the growing number of older population, our society raises the need to organise various forms of care. In contemporary society, this is considered to be a long-term care system. Since Slovenia does not yet have a long-term care system based on long-term care legislation, while the demographic trends show a great need for it, it is essential to investigate the needs of older people and the possible responses to their needs. By using the method of rapid assessment of needs and services in the Municipality of Strata, we have identified the nature and extent of long-term distress, and sought effective responses to the needs of older people following the modern guidelines of care and substitutions for institutional care. We have found that the population of the municipality is old, the young population is moving away, and the middle generation commutes daily to work outside the municipality. There is no one available to take care of the older population and this trend will continue in the future. The solutions may be found in the organisation of community assistance within the municipality and in regional integration. When planning new services, however, the trend of lowering the quality of well-being of older people, overcoming the prevailing taboos about the phenomena of old age and strengthening the autonomy and power of older people, their social network and introducing modern information and communication technology should be taken into account in the context of social policy.

AB Eco-city is a new trend of urban development in the future. Based on the theoretical research and practice of eco-city, a discrete filtering method based on evidence theory was proposed to analyze the demand of supporting facilities for the elderly at home to improve the validity of the demand analysis of supporting facilities for the elderly at home. Firstly, the original indicators of the service quality evaluation of community pension institutions are constructed to realize the project inspection and reliability analysis of the data; Secondly, the cost function is designed for the dynamic characteristic model of the demand analysis for supporting facilities in the old-age community based on the likelihood estimation algorithm, it obtains the observation matrix of dynamic characteristics of demand analysis for supporting facilities in old-age community under the condition of discrete filtering, and achieves effective defense against noise interference. Then, a real experimental environment is established to analyze and track the needs of supporting facilities in the old-age community, and the influence of noise in the process of analyzing and locating the needs of supporting facilities in the old-age community is analyzed experimentally. The experimental results show that the algorithm designed in this paper has a higher accuracy than the locating and tracking algorithm for the needs analysis of the supporting facilities of the elderly community using the discrete filtering algorithm alone, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified.

AB Under the advance of time, development of science and technology, and popularity of network, the combination of medical ecological environment and information & communication technology provides diverse medical care services for the public. Having the elderly receive diverse medical services in neighboring communities, under constantly increasing medical expenses becomes the common objective of various countries. An artificial intelligence medical service system might be the ideal tool to actualize local aging. Taking prefecture-level cities in Shanghai as samples, total 16 DMUs are studied. With the operation of Modified Delphi Method, the geometric mean is used as the consensus of experts' input/ output evaluation; and, DEA is applied to evaluate the performance on the introduction of artificial intelligence medical service system into medical ecological environment. The research results conclude that one DMU presents strong efficiency on the introduction of artificial intelligence medical service system into medical ecological environment, 6 DMUs reveal the efficiency in 0.9-1, and 9 DMUs appear the efficiency lower than 0.9. Slack Variable Analysis is further applied to improve excess and short inputs of prefecture-level cities. According to the results, suggestions are proposed, expecting that medical staff could real-time grasp the physiological state and offer timely assistance to reduce medical costs, promote the quality of life of people in communities, and improve doctor-patient interactive relationship.

AB Objective: Based on the scientific analysis and research of home and home care systems in China and abroad, this paper discussed the needs, impact factors, home care problems, development methods, solutions of urban elderly community systems and urban community elderly care in Chongqing. This may provide some policy advice for effective/economic/equal service delivery to promote the development of China's long-term elderly care. Methods: With multistage stratified cluster random sampling, we classified all the districts in Chongqing according to the economic level and then 2 or 3 districts in each level were selected to conduct an on-site survey in order to understand the utilization situation and demands on home-based care service. According to the principle of free will, a total of 1635 elderly citizens aged above 65 fulfilled the self-designated questionnaire, including general information, health condition and demand of elder care service. The statistical methods included descriptive statistics analysis, chi-square test, univariate and logistic regression analysis by SPSS 21.0. Results: A total of 1553 valid questionnaires were collected with an effective recovery of 94.98%. Investigation revealed that there were 55.9% interviewees that selected home-based care, 29.5% selected combination of home-based care and community-based care. Gender, health condition, literacy, health-payment systems, number of children, distance from their children and monthly income were the impact factors. We report that 50.7% of the population used community seniors' services, and 63% of them expressed satisfaction or satisfaction with the service; while 42.7% hoped to receive long-term service, 40.8% required emergency service, and 16.3% needed short-term service. The first three types of services required were health guidance (63.6%), life care (53.8%), and dietary guidance (40.5%). In total, 33.1% expressed a willingness to purchase home-based service and health payment systems, in which monthly income and health conditions were influencing factors. Conclusion: The home-based service for seniors is impacted by a number of factors, which presents as multi-level and diversified. The most pressing need is to provide health support. Socialization of home-based care service should be strengthened. In order to attract more professionals, the service content and supply methods should be optimized.

AB BackgroundUse of a claims-based index to identify persons with physical function impairment and at risk for long-term institutionalization would facilitate population health and comparative effectiveness research. The JEN Frailty Index [JFI] is comprised of diagnosis domains representing impairments and multimorbid clusters with high long-term institutionalization [LTI] risk. We test the index's discrimination of activities-of-daily-living [ADL] dependency and 1-year LTI and mortality in a nationally representative sample of over 12,000 Medicare beneficiaries, and compare long-term community survival stratified by ADL and JFI.Methods2004U.S. National Long-Term Care Survey data were linked to Medicare, Minimum Data Set, Veterans Health Administration files and vital statistics. ADL dependencies, JFI score, age and sex were measured at baseline survey. ADL and JFI groups were cross-tabulated generating likelihood ratios and classification statistics. Logistic regression compared discrimination (areas under receiver operating characteristic curves), multivariable calibration and accuracy of the JFI and, separately, ADLs, in predicting 1-year outcomes. Hall-Wellner bands facilitated contrasts of JFI- and ADL-stratified 5-year community survival.ResultsLikelihood ratios rose evenly across JFI risk categories. Areas under the curves of functional dependency at 3 and2 for JFI, age and sex models were 0.807 [95% c.i.: 0.795, 0.819] and 0.812 [0.801, 0.822], respectively. The area under the LTI curve for JFI and age (0.781 [0.747, 0.815]) discriminated less well than the ADL-based model (0.829 [0.799, 0.860]). Community survival separated by JFI strata was comparable to ADL strata.ConclusionsThe JEN Frailty Index with demographic covariates is a valid claims-based measure of concurrent activities-of-daily-living impairments and future long-term institutionalization risk in older populations lacking functional information.

AB Rich social relationships contribute to improved well-being and health outcomes, yet aged care client assessments tend to focus almost exclusively on physical issues. We aim to explore the experiences of aged care staff following their use of social engagement and well-being instruments as part of routine assessments for home-care clients. The social engagement (Australian Community Participation Questionnaire, ACPQ) and well-being (ICEpop CAPability Measure for Older Adults, ICECAP-O) instruments were embedded into the centralised information system of an Australian aged care provider. Staff administered these instruments during routine client assessments across a 9-month period involving 289 assessments. Semistructured interviews with 12 staff members were conducted and themes explored using qualitative content analysis. Key factors related to the acceptability of instrument adoption were found. Staff reported the instruments were convenient to use and were valuable in eliciting information for care plan development. Staff found that the instruments complemented their standard assessment procedures and did not disrupt their routine workload. They emphasised that the information gained greatly assisted their discussions with clients, identified social needs, and enhanced client involvement in decisions about desired services. There were also some challenging elements, including staff concerns regarding their ability to deal with emotional responses from clients evoked by the survey questions. ACPQ and ICECAP-O are useful tools for identifying psychosocial client needs, are feasible for use by large-scale aged care organisations and provide valuable information to guide decision-making about services. Future research should identify the long-term effects on improving social participation and client outcomes.

AB Early, conforming antibiotic treatment in elderly patients hospitalised for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a key factor in the prognosis and mortality. The objective was to examine whether empirical antibiotic treatment was conforming according to the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery guidelines in these patients. Multicentre study in patients aged >= 65 years hospitalised due to CAP in the 2013-14 and 2014-15 influenza seasons. We collected socio-demographic information, comorbidities, influenza/pneumococcal vaccination history and antibiotics administered using a questionnaire and medical records. Bivariate analyses and multilevel logistic regression were made. In total, 1857 hospitalised patients were included, 82 of whom required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Treatment was conforming in 51.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 49.1-53.8%) of patients without ICU admission and was associated with absence of renal failure without haemodialysis (odds ratio (OR) 1.49, 95% CI 1.15-1.95) and no cognitive dysfunction (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.25-2.35), when the effect of the autonomous community was controlled for. In patients with ICU admission, treatment was conforming in 45.1% (95% CI 34.1-56.1%) of patients and was associated with the hospital visits in the last year (<3 vs. >= 3, OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.03-7.12) and there was some evidence that this was associated with season. Although the reference guidelines are national, wide variability between autonomous communities was found. In patients hospitalised due to CAP, health services should guarantee the administration of antibiotics in a consensual manner that is conforming according to clinical practice guidelines.

AB Objectives The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of select adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) among a sample of American Indian (AI) adults living with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the associations between ACEs and self-rated physical and mental health. We also examined associations between sociocultural factors and health, including possible buffering processes.
   Design Survey data for this observational study were collected using computer-assisted survey interviewing techniques between 2013 and 2015.
   Setting Participants were randomly selected from AI tribal clinic facilities on five reservations in the upper Midwestern USA.
   Participants Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of T2D, age 18 years or older and self-identified as AI. The sample includes n=192 adults (55.7% female; mean age=46.3 years).
   Primary measures We assessed nine ACEs related to household dysfunction and child maltreatment. Independent variables included social support, diabetes support and two cultural factors: spiritual activities and connectedness. Primary outcomes were self-rated physical and mental health.
   Results An average of 3.05 ACEs were reported by participants and 81.9% (n=149) said they had experienced at least one ACE. Controlling for gender, age and income, ACEs were negatively associated with self-rated physical and mental health (p<0.05). Connectedness and social support were positively and significantly associated with physical and mental health. Involvement in spiritual activities was positively associated with mental health and diabetes-specific support was positively associated with physical health. Social support and diabetes-specific social support moderated associations between ACEs and physical health.
   Conclusions This research demonstrates inverse associations between ACEs and well-being of adult AI patients with diabetes. The findings further demonstrate the promise of social and cultural integration as a critical component of wellness, a point of relevance for all cultures. Health professionals can use findings from this study to augment their assessment of patients and guide them to health-promoting social support services and resources for cultural involvement.

AB Accessible primary healthcare is important to national healthcare in general and for older persons in particular, in societies where the population is ageing rapidly, as in Singapore. However, although much policy and research efforts have been put into this area, we hardly find any spatial perspective to assess the accessibility of these primary healthcare services. This paper analyzes the geographical accessibility of one major healthcare service in Singapore, namely, General Practitioners (GPs) services under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) for older persons. A Python script was developed to filter the website data of the Housing Development Board (HDB) of Singapore. The data derived was comprehensively analyzed by an Enhanced 2-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA) method based on a Gaussian distance-decay function and the GIS technique. This enabled the identification of areas with relatively weak geographical accessibility of CHAS-GPs. The findings are discussed along with suggestions for health practitioners, service planners and policy makers. Despite its initial nature, this study has demonstrated the value of innovative approaches in data collection and processing for the elderly-related studies, and contributed to the field of healthcare services optimization and possibly to other human services.

AB Introduction Primary care is an emerging area of practice for allied health practitioners. The effective integration of primary care services provided by different professions using diverse funding sources is challenging. Ireland has implemented a primary care strategy and set up primary care teams to address this. Acknowledging the ageing population in the community, fall prevention needs to be a core function of these services. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of general practitioners, occupational therapists and physiotherapists working in the primary care setting about falls prevention in their practice.
   Method Three general practitioners, five occupational therapists and three physiotherapists were interviewed from primary care teams in the counties of Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary, Ireland. Interviews were in person or by telephone and audiotaped, transcribed and analysed thematically.
   Results Two key themes emerged from the data: the level of primary care team integration and the nature of community fall prevention, linked by referral mechanisms.
   Conclusion Providing comprehensive falls prevention services in the primary care context is complex. Integrated processes and pathways in primary care teams are needed to identify older people at risk of falls and to engage a whole of primary care approach to fall prevention.

AB Residential care centres for elders (RCCEs) in Romania have rapidly developed over the last two decades. In the absence of coherent policies regarding elderly people, RCCEs are mainly the result of businesses arising from an acceleration of the ageing process in Romania. This study uses a multidimensional approach to investigate issues related to the sustainability of ageing in RCCEs in Romania. Specifically, it aims to analyse whether the grouping of RCCEs is following the distribution of elderly Romanian population likely to require such amenities, and whether the characteristics and services of these facilities were appropriate for their users in line with World Health Organization's Agenda of Ageing. The research relies on a combination of quantitative methods by Geographical Information System (GIS) spatial analysis, and qualitative methods by interviews. The results show that remote rural areas have clusters with high shares of aged population, while the distribution of the RCCEs prevails in large cities, being partly adapted to socio-spatial requirements, and the general trends of the demographic ageing process. These findings are in contrast with the dominant perception of RCCE beneficiaries, who want to be closer to their domiciles, as they are more oriented towards family values, emotionally affected by separation from their relatives, consider themselves socially and spatially segregated groups in care centres, although aware of the need for long-term institutional care. The study reveals the necessity for optimising health policies for elders, by improving the socio-spatial management of such services and building age-friendly environments in long-term care in consent with WHO calls.

AB Background: Public insurance reforms of the past two decades have failed to substantively address the healthcare needs of American Indians in general, let alone the particular needs of American Indian elders, ages 55 years and older. Historically, this population is more likely to be uninsured and to suffer from greater morbidities, poorer health outcomes and quality of life, and lower life expectancies compared to all other United States aging populations, representing a neglected group within the healthcare system. Despite the pervasive belief that the Indian Health Service will address all their health-related needs, American Indian elders are negatively affected by gaps in insurance and lack of access to health care. While the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act included provisions to ameliorate disparities for American Indians, its future is uncertain. In this context, American Indian elders with variable health literacy must navigate a complex and unstable healthcare system, regardless of where they seek care.
   Methods: This community-driven study features a mixed-method, participatory design to examine help-seeking behavior and healthcare experiences of American Indian elders in New Mexico, in order to develop and evaluate a tailored intervention to enhance knowledge of, access to, and use of insurance and available services to reduce healthcare disparities. This study includes qualitative and quantitative interviews combined with concept mapping and focus groups with American Indian elders and other key stakeholders.
   Discussion: The information gathered will generate new practical knowledge, grounded in actual perspectives of American Indian elders and other relevant stakeholders, to improve healthcare practices and policies for a population that has been largely excluded from national and state discussions of healthcare reform. Study data will inform development and evaluation of culturally tailored programming to enhance understanding and facilitate negotiation of the changing landscape of health care by American Indian elders. This work will fill a gap in research on public insurance initiatives, which do not typically focus on this population, and will offer a replicable model for enhancing the effects of such initiatives on other underserved groups affected by healthcare inequities.

AB Background: Aging is a normal degenerative process that results in a decline in the gait and balance performance of older adults. Interactive cognitive motor training is an intervention that integrates cognitive and motor tasks to promote individuals' physical and cognitive fall risk factors. However, the additive effects of the interactive cognitive motor training on objective quantitative data and comprehensive descriptions of gait and balance warrants further investigation.
   Objectives: To investigate the effect of interactive cognitive motor training on older adults' gait and balance from immediate to long-term time points.
   Design: A double-blind randomized control trial.
   Settings: Four senior service centers and community service centers in Taiwan.
   Participants: 62 older adults who met the inclusion criteria.
   Methods: The study participants were older adults without cognitive impairment, and they were randomly allocated to the experimental group or active control group. In both groups, older adults participated in three sessions of 30-min training per week for a total of 8 weeks, with the total number of training sessions being 24. The primary outcome was gait performance, which was measured using objective and subjective indicators. iWALK was used as an objective indicator to measure pace and dynamic stability; the Functional Gait Assessment was employed as a subjective indicator. The secondary outcome was balance performance, which was measured using iSWAY. A generalized estimating equation was used to identify whether the results of the two groups differ after receiving different intervention measures; the results were obtained from immediate to long-term posttests.
   Results: Stride length in the pace category of the experimental group improved significantly in immediate posttest (p = 0.01), 3-month follow-up (p = 0.01), and 6-month follow-up (p = 0.04). The range of motion of the leg exhibited significant improvement in immediate posttest (p = 0.04) and 3-month follow-up (p = 0.04). The Functional Gait Assessment result indicated that statistically significant improvement was observed in immediate posttest (p = 0.02) and 12-month follow-up (p = 0.01). The results of balance performance showed that the experimental group attained statistically significant improvement in centroid frequency in the immediate posttest (p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: The research results validated that the 24 sessions of the interactive cognitive motor training intervention significantly improved gait and balance performance. Future studies should extend the sample to communities to promote the gait and balance performance of community-dwelling older adults without cognitive impairment and reduce their risk of falling and developing gait-related diseases.

AB Background: Most training programs for self-management of chronic diseases in Korea currently involve face-to-face interactions primarily in a health care setting. Therefore, older Koreans living in the community continue to seek other training opportunities for the management of chronic diseases. This has led to the development of new training methods, such as mobile health (mHealth) care, which are valuable in community centers and homes.
   Objective: This feasibility study (1) developed an mHealth training protocol to empower community-dwelling elderly individuals to manage their chronic diseases; (2) examined the feasibility of delivering this mHealth training protocol to elderly individuals through mobile tablets and applications (apps); and (3) discussed the contextual and methodological challenges associated with the development of this protocol.
   Methods: The mHealth training protocol was developed based on the eHealth Enhanced Chronic Care Model and comprised of four phases. Phase 1 included standardized technology (mobile tablets) training using guidebooks, demonstrations, and guided practice. Phase 2 included provision of standardized information about disease management that was obtained from governmental and professional health care organizations. Phase 3 included provision of training on the use of high-quality mHealth apps that were selected based on individual diagnoses. Phase 4 included encouraging the patients to practice using self-selected mHealth apps based on their individual needs. Quantitative descriptive statistics and qualitative content analyses of user evaluations were used to assess the feasibility and user acceptance of this protocol.
   Results: Of the 27 older adults included in this study, 25 completed all 4 weeks of the mHealth training. The attrition rate was 7% (2/27), and the reasons included time conflicts, emotional distress, and/or family discouragement. The men required little or no training for Phase 1, and in comparison with men, women seemed to depend more on the mHealth trainers in Phase 3. Gender, level of education, and previous experience of using smartphones were associated with the speed of learning, level of confidence, and overall competence.
   Conclusions: A tailored and personalized approach is required to develop mHealth training protocols for older adults. Self-management of chronic diseases via mHealth training requires careful consideration of the complex nature of human behavior, emotional responses, and familial influences. Therefore, integration of a theoretical, clinical, and technical approach is necessary for the successful development and implementation of an mHealth training program that targets older adults with chronic diseases in a community setting.

AB AimTo investigate the effects of a case management intervention for community-dwelling frail older people, with functional dependency and repeated contacts with the healthcare services, focusing on loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction.
   DesignA two-armed, nonblinded, randomised control trial with repeated follow-ups, of N = 153 participants at baseline allocated to an intervention (n = 80) and control (n = 73) group.
   MethodInclusion criteria were the following: 65 years of age, living in ordinary housing, in need of assistance in two or more self-reported activities of daily living, having at least two hospital admissions or at least four visits in outpatient care 12 months prior to enrolment. Case managers (nurses and physiotherapists) provided an intervention of general case management, general information, specific information and continuity and safety. The intervention ranged over 12 months with one or more home visit(s) being conducted per month. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied for the primary outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, along with complete case and sensitivity analyses.
   ResultsDuring the trial period n = 12 died and n = 33 dropped out. No significant difference was found between the groups at baseline regarding sociodemographic characteristics, subjective health or primary outcomes. The intention-to-treat analysis did not result in any significant effects for the primary outcomes at any of the follow-ups (6 and 12 months). The complete case analysis resulted in a significant difference in favour of the intervention regarding loneliness (RR = 0.49, p = 0.028) and life satisfaction (ES = 0.41, p = 0.028) at 6 months and for depressive symptoms (ES = 0.47, p = 0.035) at 12 months.
   ConclusionsThe use of case management for frail older people did not result in clear favourable effects for the primary outcomes. However, the study indicates that case management may be beneficial in terms of these outcomes. Due to the complexity of the outcomes, an elaboration of the components and assessments is suggested.

AB Introduction:Rural geographic isolation may act as a promoting or restraining variable to the diffusion of technology and healthy aging in the community. Telehome monitoring (TM) leverages technology to support seniors living in the community with chronic conditions. To date, limited research has investigated the utilization of TM in rural settings. This study assesses the comparative utilization of TM for patients with heart failure in rural versus urban environments.Materials and Methods:We conducted a cross-sectional study involving chart reviews of all patients enrolled in the TM program at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute during 2014. Data were extracted on urban/rural status, demographic characteristics, and process and outcomes of care. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted.Results:More rural patients did not have a documented reason for emergency room visits compared to urban patients. There was no significant association between the urban/rural status and the process and outcome measures at the multivariate level. Being followed-up regularly by a family physician and a specialist, as opposed to a specialist or general practitioner only, was associated with significantly longer TM period and a higher number of diuretic adjustments and calls made by nurses.Discussion:Although more urban patients were older and living alone, their profile did not affect their utilization of TM. The difference in diagnosis between urban and rural patients also did not contribute to such differences. Hence, there is no variation in the process and outcome measures associated with the utilization of TM between urban and rural environments.Conclusions:Rural patients may not be perceived as extensive users of resources nor patients who represent challenges in terms of feasibility of TM use.

AB Objectives: To determine the feasibility of implementing a pharmacist-led pharmacogenomics (PGx) service for the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE).
   Setting: A national centralized pharmacy providing PGx services to community-based PACE centers.
   Practice description: Individuals 55 years of age and older enrolled in PACE who underwent PGx testing as part of their medical care (n = 296).
   Practice innovation: Pharmacist-led PGx testing, interpreting, and consulting.
   Evaluation: Implementation processes and roles were ascertained by reviewing policies and procedures for the PGx service and documented observations made by pharmacists providing the service. Genetic variants and drug-gene interactions (DGIs) were determined by interpretations of PGx test results. Types of recommendations provided by pharmacists were ascertained from PGx consultations. Prescribers' acceptance of recommendations were ascertained by documented responses or drug changes made after PGx consultations.
   Results: Challenges to implementation included lack of systems interoperability, limited access to medical electronic health records, determining prescribers' responses, and knowledge and competency gaps in PGx. Pharmacist roles most essential to overcoming challenges were interpreting and applying PGx data, determining how to disseminate those data to prescribers, advocating for appropriate PGx testing, and educating about the application of test results to clinical practice. Participants frequently used drugs posing DGI risks, with the majority (73.6%) reporting more than 1 interaction. The overwhelming majority (89.0%) of pharmacists' recommendations to mitigate risks were accepted by referring prescribers.
   Conclusion: Implementing a pharmacist-led PGx service for PACE is feasible. Implementation of this service highlights the leadership role of pharmacists in moving PGx from research to practice. (C) 2018 American Pharmacists Association (R). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectiveFew studies have explored behavioral strategies for managing chronic pain in older adults. Pain Care Management (PCM) is a telephone-based behavioral intervention for chronic pain. The present study examined chronic pain characteristics among older adults and tested the delivery of PCM as an adjunct to depression and anxiety care management.
   MethodsParticipants were drawn from a state-sponsored program offering care management services to community members aged 65 and older who were prescribed a psychotropic medication by a primary care provider. Chronic pain information was collected for all participants in the state program (N=250) and treatment outcome data were collected for a subset with significant chronic pain. Eighty participants with high chronic pain interference were offered PCM and compared to 80 participants with chronic pain who received monitoring only on depression, anxiety, and pain interference outcomes.
   ResultsChronic pain was identified in 14% of older adults newly prescribed a psychotropic medication. Compared to monitoring only, PCM participants had higher odds of seeing a reduction of 2 or more points in pain interference at 6months. Pain care management participants' anxiety scores significantly decreased over the study period.
   ConclusionsOlder adults treated with psychotropic medications often also experience chronic pain that interferes with daily activities. A telephone-based care management intervention is acceptable and feasible with an older community-based population and can lead to improvements in anxiety symptoms and interference from chronic pain. Further research will help to refine interventions that may help improve symptoms and increase functioning with this population.

AB Objectives: To understand the increasingly important role of digital citizenship (the ability to participate in society online) in supporting the well-being of ageing migrants. Study design: Participant observation, social network mapping, ethnographic and life-history interviews.
   Methods: Fifteen in-depth case' studies examined the role of online participation in fostering the well-being and care of older migrants in Perth, Western Australia. Participants are members of an 'internet cafe that facilitates their shared development of Internet skills. The case studies are derived from ethnographic research conducted between July and October 2016.
   Results: Older peoples' maintenance of support networks and social engagement, and their access to healthcare services, can be enhanced when they are motivated to increase their digital literacy (the ability to use the Internet for information and communication) through appropriate educational, technological, infrastructure and social support. This support is likely to be more effective when developed through social learning systems that create communities of practice. Improving digital literacy has special implications for the wellbeing of older migrants because it can enhance their ability to exchange emotional support across distance.
   Conclusions: Digital literacy for older migrants can dramatically increase their ability to maintain and expand dispersed networks of support. Effective implementation of affordable and age-inclusive information and communication technology (ITC) infrastructure requires integrated support that connects individuals and their homes with social learning systems to ensure that participation continues as mobility declines. As health information and social engagement are increasingly delivered through online platforms, supporting the digital citizenship of older people is becoming an important equity issue.

AB Background: The use of the internet for health information among older people is receiving increasing attention, but how it is associated with chronic health conditions and health service use at concurrent and subsequent time points using nationally representative data is less known.
   Objective: This study aimed to determine whether the use of the internet for health information is associated with health service utilization and whether the association is affected by specific health conditions.
   Methods: The study used data collected in a technology module from a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older Americans aged 52 years and above from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study (HRS; N=991). Negative binomial regressions were used to examine the association between use of Web-based health information and the reported health service uses in 2012 and 2014. Analyses included additional covariates adjusting for predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Interactions between the use of the internet for health information and chronic health conditions were also tested.
   Results: A total of 48.0% (476/991) of Americans aged 52 years and above reported using Web-based health information. The use of Web-based health information was positively associated with the concurrent reports of doctor visits, but not over 2 years. However, an interaction of using Web-based health information with diabetes showed that users had significantly fewer doctor visits compared with nonusers with diabetes at both times.
   Conclusions: The use of the internet for health information was associated with higher health service use at the concurrent time, but not at the subsequent time. The interaction between the use of the internet for health information and diabetes was significant at both time points, which suggests that health-related internet use may be associated with fewer doctor visits for certain chronic health conditions. Results provide some insight into how Web-based health information may provide an alternative health care resource for managing chronic conditions.

   an NHS Test Bed in North West England
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction The Lancashire and Cumbria Innovation Alliance (LCIA) Test Bed is a partnership between the National Health Service in England, industry (led by Philips) and Lancaster University. Through the implementation of a combination of innovative health technologies and practices, it aims to determine the most effective and cost-effective ways of supporting frail older people with long-term conditions to remain well in the community. Among the Test Bed's objectives are to improve patient activation and the ability of older people to self-care at home, reduce healthcare system utilisation, and deliver increased workforce productivity.
   Methods and analysis Patients aged 55 years and over are recruited to four cohorts defined by their risk of hospital admission, with long-term conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, diabetes and heart failure. The programme is determined on an individual basis, with a range of technologies available. The evaluation is adopting a two-phase approach: phase 1 includes a bespoke patient survey and a mass matched control analysis; and phase 2 is using observational interviews with patients, and weekly diaries, action learning meetings and focus groups with members of staff and other key stakeholders. Phase 1 data analysis consists of a statistical evaluation of the effectiveness of the programme. A health economic analysis of its costs and associated cost changes will be undertaken. Phase 2 data will be analysed thematically with the aid of Atlas. ti qualitative software. The evaluation is located within a logic model framework, to consider the processes, management and participation that may have implications for the Test Bed's success.
   Ethics and dissemination The LCIA Test Bed evaluation has received ethical approval from the Health Research Authority and Lancaster University's Faculty of Health and Medicine Research Ethics Committee. A range of dissemination methods are adopted, including deliberative panels to validate findings and develop outcomes for policy and practice.

   older adults in the Netherlands: a user-centred design

AB Background: Recent transitions in long-term care in the Netherlands have major consequences for community-dwelling older adults. A new paradigm expects them to manage and arrange their own care and support as much as possible. Technology can support this shift. A study has been conducted to explore the needs of communityd-welling frail older adults with regard to an online platform. An existing platform was subsequently modified, based upon these needs, resulting in an online community care platform (OCC-platform) comprising of care, health, and communication functions. The purpose of this platform was to support frail older adults in their independence and functioning, by stimulating self-care and providing reliable information, products and services.
   Methods: The study used a User-Centred Design. The development processes involved the following steps: Step 1) Identification of the User Requirements. To assess the user requirements, direct observations (N = 3) and interviews (N = 14) were performed. Step 2) Modification of an Existing Online Platform. Based upon Step 1, available online platforms were explored to determine whether an existing useful product was available. Two companies collaborated in modifying such a platform; Step 3) Testing the Modified Platform. A total of 73 older adults were invited to test a prototype of the OCC-platform during 6 months, which comprised of two phases: (1) a training phase; and (2) a testing phase.
   Results: An iterative process of modifications resulted in an interactive software concept on a Standard PC, containing 11 Functions. The Functions of 'contacts', 'services' and 'messaging', were by far, the most frequently used. The use was at its highest during the first 2 weeks of the testing and then its use steadily declined. The vast majority of the subjects (94%) were positive about the usability of the platform. Only a minority of the subjects (27%) indicated that the platform had added value for them.
   Conclusion: The overall prospect was that an OCC-platform can contribute to the social participation and the self-management competencies of frail older adults, together with their social cohesion in the community. In order to validate these prospects, further research is needed on the characteristics and the impact of online platforms.

   DEFINITIONS; INSIGHTS; ADULTS
AB Objective To assess the performance of currently available sepsis recognition tools in patients referred to a community-based acute ambulatory care unit.
   Design Service evaluation of consecutive patients over a 4-month period.
   Setting Community-based acute ambulatory care unit.
   Data collection and outcome
   measures Observations, blood results and outcome data were analysed from patients with a suspected infection. Clinical features at first assessment were used to populate sepsis recognition tools including: systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criteria. Scores were assessed against the clinical need for escalated care (use of intravenous antibiotics, fluids, ongoing ambulatory care or hospital treatment) and poor clinical outcome (all-cause mortality and readmission at 30 days after index assessment).
   Results Of 533 patients (median age 81 years), 316 had suspected infection with 120 patients requiring care escalated beyond simple community care. SIRS had the highest positive predictive value (50.9%, 95% CI 41.6% to 60.3%) and negative predictive value (68.9%, 95% CI 62.6% to 75.3%) for the need for escalated care. Both NEWS and SIRS were better at predicting the need for escalated care than qSOFA and NICE criteria in patients with suspected infection (all P< 0.001). While new-onset confusion predicted the need for escalated care for infection in patients >= 85 years old (n=114), 23.7% of patients >= 85 years had new-onset confusion without evidence for infection.
   Conclusions Acute ambulatory care clinicians should use caution in applying the new NICE endorsed criteria for determining the need for intravenous therapy and hospital-based location of care. NICE criteria have poorer performance when compared against NEWS and SIRS and new-onset confusion was prevalent in patients aged >= 85 years without infection.

AB Accessible summary Dementia is an illness caused by damage to a person's brain. People with learning disabilities, especially people with Down's Syndrome, are more likely to get dementia, and when they are younger. We talked to people working in community learning disability teams to find out what they thought about services and support for people with learning disabilities and dementia and carers. Screening and assessments mean that people get diagnosis and support more quickly and other problems are picked up. More appropriate housing and support is needed so people can stay at home for longer. Research needs to look at the best ways to support people with learning disabilities and dementia. It is important to find ways to involve people with learning disabilities and dementia and carers in meetings about their support and future research.
   Abstract Background Dementia prevalence rates are higher amongst people with learning disabilities than the general population. People with Down's syndrome are at even greater risk of developing dementia and of developing dementia at an earlier age. This study, conducted as part of a wider service evaluation, explored community learning disability team perspectives on screening, pathways, training, information and supports developed to improve services for people with learning disabilities and dementia.
   Methods A focus group was held with health and social care professionals working in community learning disability services. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.
   Results The dementia screening, pathways and processes had become embedded in practice, leading to a common framework, an efficient, multidisciplinary, proactive approach, earlier detection and diagnosis of dementia and identification of other health needs and issues. This avoided crisis situations supporting people to remain at home longer. Training and information were felt to improve care quality and reduce caregiver anxiety. People with learning disabilities and caregivers were involved to varying extents. External influences impacting on support included the availability, appropriateness, cost and effectiveness of different models of service provision.
   Conclusions Service developments have been made as a result of the findings which suggest that dementia pathways and supports improve service provision and outcomes for people with learning disabilities. It is important to develop the evidence base on the effectiveness of different service models for people with learning disabilities and dementia. Future studies need to gather views of people with learning disabilities and carers.

AB Organisations promoting health and social outcomes are grappling with two concurrent realities: dwindling budgets and declining state support; and a rapidly ageing population. This is true for all levels of government, non-governmental organisations and non-profits. This study assessed the process and extent to which four non-profit organisations collaborated to meet service objectives related to older adults in a local area. A collaboration survey and semi-structured interviews with nine stakeholders from four community-based public-sector organisations were conducted annually for three years. Interviews were transcribed and data were analysed using topic and analytic coding. Successful inter-agency collaborations involved: (i) shared vision; (ii) effective communication; (iii) time to build relationships; (iv) shared expertise and resources; and (v) strong leadership. Factors that jeopardised inter-agency collaboration included: (i) misinformed understanding of goals; (ii) meetings seen as a waste of time; (iii) not sharing resources; and (iv) lack of organisational resources. This paper makes two distinct contributions. We highlight that successful collaborations are about a process that includes relationship building, sharing of resources and establishing a shared vision; and we offer a method for those involved in the establishment and assessment of collaborations to provide appropriate, accessible and timely assessments of collaborative efforts.

AB Background: This study introduces the conceptual basis and operational measure, of BioPyschoSocial (BPS) health and related risk to better understand how well older people are managing and to screen for risk status. The BPS Risk Screener is constructed to detect vulnerability at older ages, and seeks to measure dynamic processes that place equal emphasis on Psycho-emotional and Socio-interpersonal risks, as Bio-functional ones. We validate the proposed measure and describe its application to programming.
   Methods: We undertook a quantitative cross-sectional, psychometric study with n = 1325 older Singaporeans, aged 60 and over. We adapted the EASYCare 2010 and Lubben Social Network Scale questionnaires to help determine the BPS domains using factor analysis from which we derive the BPS Risk Screener items. We then confirm its structure, and test the scoring system. The score is initially validated against self-reported general health then modelled against: number of falls; cognitive impairment; longstanding diseases; and further tested against service utilization (linked administrative data).
   Results: Three B, P and S clusters are defined and identified and a BPS managing score ('doing' well, or 'some', 'many', and 'overwhelming problems') calculated such that the risk of problematic additive BPS effects, what we term health 'loads', are accounted for. Thirty-five items (factor loadings over 0.5) clustered into three distinct B, P, S domains and were found to be independently associated with self-reported health: B: 1.99 (1.64 to 2.41), P: 1.59 (1.28 to 1.98), S: 1.33 (1.10 to 1.60). The fit improved when combined into the managing score 2.33 (1.92 to 2.83, < 0.01). The score was associated with mounting risk for all outcomes.
   Conclusions: BPS domain structures, and the novel scoring system capturing dynamic BPS additive effects, which can combine to engender vulnerability, are validated through this analysis. The resulting tool helps render clients' risk status and related intervention needs transparent. Given its explicit and empirically supported attention to P and S risks, which have the potential to be more malleable than B ones, especially in the older old, this tool is designed to be change sensitive.

AB Home and community engagement are key contextual factors for aging well, particularly for older adults in vulnerable social positions. A community-based participatory action research project conducted in Western Canada examined how to best use the shared amenity spaces in a low-income seniors' apartment complex in order to connect services and programs with tenants and to provide opportunities for service providers and local stakeholders to build upon and create new relationships toward collaboration and service delivery.
   Pre-move deliberative dialogue workshops (n = 4) were conducted with stakeholders (e.g., service providers, developers, and municipal government employees). Workshop participants (n = 24) generated ideas and plans on how physical and social environments can contribute to the social engagement of senior tenants.
   Shared dialogue led to community investment and asset sharing by integrating the knowledge and experiences of multiple stakeholder groups into the planning process. This article highlights how collaborative planning approaches for the effective use of the social environment (e.g., social programming), within the physical environment (e.g., amenity and community spaces), can generate rich and illuminating data for informing enhancements in the social environment of apartment dwelling low-income seniors. Contextual challenges to service provision are discussed, including the need for communication about and coordination of on-site programming, culturally diverse and responsive programming, and long-term funding.
   Prolonging independent community living with the assistance of support services should be a goal to both delay premature relocation into institutional care and meet the preferences of older adults.

AB Objective: To examine home care service-related and person-based factors associated with time to entry into permanent residential aged care.
   Design: Longitudinal cohort study using routinely collected client management data.
   Setting: A large aged care service provider in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, Australia.
   Participants: A total of 1116 people aged 60 years and older who commenced home care services for higher-level needs between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016.
   Methods: Survival analysis methods were used to examine service-related and person-based factors that were associated with time between first home care service and entry into permanent residential aged care. Predictors included service hours per week, combination of service types, demographics, needs, hospital leave, and change in care level. Cluster analysis was used to determine patterns of types of services used.
   Results: By December 31, 2016, 21.1% of people using home care services had entered into permanent residential care (n = 235). After adjusting for significant factors such as age and care needs, each hour of service received per week was associated with a 6% lower risk of entry into residential care (hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.90-0.98). People who were predominant users of social support services, those with an identified carer, and those born in a non-main English-speaking country also remained in their own homes for longer.
   Conclusions: Greater volume of home care services was associated with significantly delayed entry into permanent residential care. This study provides much-needed evidence about service outcomes that could be used to inform older adults' care choices.

AB Background: Although digital technologies can mitigate the burdens of home healthcare services caused by an ageing population that lives at home longer with complex health problems, research on the impacts and consequences of digitalised remote communication between patients and caregivers is lacking. The present study explores how home healthcare professionals had experienced the introduction of digital medicine dispensers and their influence on patient-caregiver relationships.
   Methods: The multi-case study comprised semi-structured interviews with 21 healthcare professionals whose home healthcare service involved using the digital medicine dispensers. The constant comparative method was used for data analyses.
   Results: Altogether, interviewed healthcare professionals reported three main technology-related impacts upon their patient-caregiver relationships. First, national and local pressure to increase efficiency had troubled their relationships with patients who suspected that municipalities have sought to lower costs by reducing and digitalising services. Participants reported having to consider such worries when introducing technologies into their services. Second, participants reported a shift towards empowering patients. Digital technology can empower patients who value their independence, whereas safety is more important for other patients. Healthcare professionals needed to ensure that replacing care tasks with technology implies safe and improved care. Third, the safety and quality of digital healthcare services continues to depend upon surveillance and control mechanisms that compensate for less face-to-face monitoring. Participants did not consider the possibility that surveillance exposes information about patients' everyday lives to be problematic, but to constitute opportunities for adjusting services to meet patients' needs.
   Conclusions: Technologies such as digital medicine dispensers can improve the efficiency of healthcare services and enhance patients' independence when introduced in a way that empowers patients as well as safeguards trust and service quality. Conversely, the patient-caregiver relationship can suffer if the technology does not meet patients' needs and fails to offer safe and trustworthy services. Upon introducing technology, home healthcare professionals therefore need to carefully consider the benefits and possible disadvantages of the technology. Ethical implications for both individuals and societies need to be further discussed.

AB Introduction: Although there is no cure for osteoarthritis (OA), there are lifestyle modifications that can mitigate symptoms such as pain, and improve management of the disease. This information is not always translated to community-dwelling seniors. Individuals in rural areas often face additional challenges due to geographic isolation and decreased access to community services.
   Methods: We used qualitative research methodology (hermeneutic phenomenology) to better understand the lived experiences of urban and rural community-dwelling seniors diagnosed with OA. We explored their sources of information about OA, how they manage their OA pain, and how OA management could be improved in the community. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit 20 information-rich participants (11 urban, 9 rural) in Ontario, Canada. All participants were aged >65 and diagnosed with OA. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. N Vivo 11 Pro qualitative software was used to code transcripts.
   Results: Thematic analysis revealed 9 key themes where 8 were common to urban and rural participants, and 1 was unique to rural participants. Most significant among the common themes was the description of the social network as a source of OA information, the trial-and-error approach used for OA management, and the individual contextualization of OA management. Our results suggest that there are several common experiences among urban-and rural-dwelling seniors living with OA, including the desire for support over time, but also a unique experience to rural-dwelling seniors, namely lack of access to local care.
   Conclusion: These findings can be used to improve translation of OA information in both urban and rural communities in Canada, highlighting that common strategies may be effective in different contexts for this disease.

AB Objective: The Care Transitions Intervention (CTI) has potential to improve the emergency department (ED)-to-home transition for older adults. Community paramedics may function as the CTI coaches; however, this requires the appropriate knowledge, skills, and attitudes, which they do not receive in traditional emergency medical services (EMS) education. This study aimed to define community paramedics' perceptions regarding their training needs to serve as CTI coaches supporting the ED-to-home transition. Methods: This study forms part of an ongoing randomized controlled trial evaluating a community paramedic-implemented CTI to enhance the ED-to-home transition. The community paramedics' training covered the following domains: the CTI program, geriatrics, effective coaching, ED discharge processes, and community paramedicine. Sixteen months after starting the study, we conducted audio-recorded semi-structured interviews with community paramedics at both study sites. After transcribing the interviews, team members independently coded the transcripts. Ensuing group analysis sessions led to the development of final codes and identifying common themes. Finally, we conducted member checking to confirm our interpretations of the interview data. Results: We interviewed all 8 participating community paramedics. Participants consisted solely of non-Hispanic whites, included 5 women, and had a mean age of 43. Participants had extensive backgrounds in healthcare, primarily as EMS providers, but minimal experience with community paramedicine. All reported some prior geriatrics training. Four themes emerged from the interviews: (1) paramedics with positive attitudes and willingness to acquire the needed knowledge and skills will succeed as CTI coaches; (2) active rather than passive learning is preferred by paramedics; (3) the existing training could benefit from adjustments such as added content on mental health, dementia, and substance abuse issues, as well as content on coaching subjects with a range of illness severity; and (4) continuing education should address the paramedic coaches' evolving needs as they develop proficiency with the CTI. Conclusions: Paramedics as CTI coaches represent an untapped resource for supporting ED-to-home care transitions. Our results provide the necessary first step to make the community paramedic CTI coach more successful. These findings may apply to training for similar community paramedicine roles, but additional research must investigate this possibility.

AB Rapid advances in information and sensor technology have led to the development of tools and methods for personalized health monitoring. These techniques support timely and efficient healthcare services by tracking the vital signs, detecting physiological changes and predicting health risks. In this paper, we propose an integrated system to monitor the wellness condition of elderly. This system is conceptualized to provide a computer-aided decision support for clinicians and community nurses, by means of which they can easily monitor and analyze an elderly's overall activity and vital signs using a wearable wellness tracker and an all-in-one satiation-based monitoring device, offering an efficient solution with a reduction in time cost and human error. We design a data-preparing scheme for acquiring data and processing data from multiple monitoring devices, and propose a personalized scheme for forecasting the elderly's one-day-ahead wellness condition via data integration and statistical learning. We conduct a pilot study at a nursing home in Hong Kong to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed system. The proposed forecasting scheme is validated by the collected data.

TI Eliciting community perspectives on research with older adults living

AB Approximately half of all people living with HIV in the US are age 50 and older. Existing research highlights the health challenges of these individuals, but little work has focused on gathering input about concerns in participating in HIV and aging research. Prior to designing a prospective cohort study on HIV and aging, we elicited feedback from potential participants on general attitudes toward participation in a prospective HIV cohort study, and perspectives on important research topics relevant to older adults living with HIV.
   Three qualitative focus groups were formed.
   Three focus groups (5-7 participants each; N=18) were held with older adults living with HIV. All discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using content analysis.
   Participants emphasized the importance of data confidentiality, shared concerns about study biases arising from sponsored research, and suggested that conflicts of interest should be independently assessed by "representative" boards made of community members. They urged researchers to be mindful of research "burnout," because many people with HIV participate in multiple research studies. A number of priority research areas emerged, including the gap in provision of end-of-life services.
   Many older adults with HIV are knowledgeable about the research process and offer valuable insights to researchers. Addressing participant concerns can facilitate inclusion and enhance HIV research success.

TI Home-based health promotion for older people with mild frailty: the

AB Background: Mild frailty or pre-frailty is common and yet is potentially reversible. Preventing progression to worsening frailty may benefit individuals and lower health/social care costs. However, we know little about effective approaches to preventing frailty progression.
   Objectives: (1) To develop an evidence-and theory-based home-based health promotion intervention for older people with mild frailty. (2) To assess feasibility, costs and acceptability of (i) the intervention and (ii) a full-scale clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness randomised controlled trial (RCT).
   Design: Evidence reviews, qualitative studies, intervention development and a feasibility RCT with process evaluation.
   Intervention development: Two systematic reviews (including systematic searches of 14 databases and registries, 1990-2016 and 1980-2014), a state-of-the-art review (from inception to 2015) and policy review identified effective components for our intervention. We collected data on health priorities and potential intervention components from semistructured interviews and focus groups with older people (aged 65-94 years) (n = 44), carers (n = 12) and health/social care professionals (n = 27). These data, and our evidence reviews, fed into development of the 'HomeHealth' intervention in collaboration with older people and multidisciplinary stakeholders. 'HomeHealth' comprised 3-6 sessions with a support worker trained in behaviour change techniques, communication skills, exercise, nutrition and mood. Participants addressed self-directed independence and well-being goals, supported through education, skills training, enabling individuals to overcome barriers, providing feedback, maximising motivation and promoting habit formation.
   Feasibility RCT: Single-blind RCT, individually randomised to ` HomeHealth' or treatment as usual (TAU).
   Setting: Community settings in London and Hertfordshire, UK.
   Participants: A total of 51 community-dwelling adults aged = 65 years with mild frailty.
   Main outcome measures: Feasibility - recruitment, retention, acceptability and intervention costs. Clinical and health economic outcome data at 6 months included functioning, frailty status, well-being, psychological distress, quality of life, capability and NHS and societal service utilisation/costs.
   Results: We successfully recruited to target, with good 6-month retention (94%). Trial procedures were acceptable with minimal missing data. Individual randomisation was feasible. The intervention was acceptable, with good fidelity and modest delivery costs (307 pound per patient). A total of 96% of participants identified at least one goal, which were mostly exercise related (73%). We found significantly better functioning (Barthel Index +1.68; p = 0.004), better grip strength (+6.48 kg; p = 0.02), reduced psychological distress (12-item General Health Questionnaire -3.92; p = 0.01) and increased capability-adjusted life-years [+0.017; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.001 to 0.031] at 6 months in the intervention arm than the TAU arm, with no differences in other outcomes. NHS and carer support costs were variable but, overall, were lower in the intervention arm than the TAU arm. The main limitation was difficulty maintaining outcome assessor blinding.
   Conclusions: Evidence is lacking to inform frailty prevention service design, with no large-scale trials of multidomain interventions. From stakeholder/public perspectives, new frailty prevention services should be personalised and encompass multiple domains, particularly socialising and mobility, and can be delivered by trained non-specialists. Our multicomponent health promotion intervention was acceptable and delivered at modest cost. Our small study shows promise for improving clinical outcomes, including functioning and independence. A full-scale individually RCT is feasible.

AB Background: A subset of individuals who inefficiently and frequently use emergency department (ED) services are called super-utilizers. Our healthcare system is fragmented and complex, making it difficult for providers to identify super-utilizers and address their wide range of health issues. Objective: The objective of our study was to evaluate a novel community-wide collaboration program called CARES (Community Assistance Referral and Education Services) designed to identify super-utilizers through local partnering organizations. CARES assists patients in developing their personal health and wellness goals, and navigates them away from 9-1-1 calls, emergency room visits, and hospital admissions, and toward more appropriate resources over 90days. Methods: This was a retrospective observational analysis of the CARES program. Data were collected from March 2013 to December 2015. The study population included: enrolled adults with non-compliance of medication or treatment; behavioral health problems; multiple 9-1-1 responses in a short period of time; three or more ED visits within six months; patients with multiple hospital admissions. Adults who were outside of the study period or had missing outcome information were excluded. The primary outcomes of this study were the median rate of 9-1-1 calls/month/person, ED and hospital visits/month/person. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare changes between pre- vs. post-enrollment for each subject. Results: A total of 441 subjects were included in this study. The majority of patients (64%) were female, 64% were white, and the median (IQR) age was 48 (35-62) years old. A total of 51% were on Medicaid and 69% identified behavioral health issues as their barriers to optimal health care. Between pre- and post-enrollment periods, the median (IQR) monthly rate of 9-1-1 calls, ED visits, and hospital admissions significantly decreased by 0.26 (-0.06, 0.90), 0.25 (-0.08, 0.71), and 0.18 (0.04, 0.53) (p < 0.001 for all). Conclusions: When health systems in a geographic area share data, they are better able to recognize patterns of overuse, and address them properly. This study demonstrated that a collaborative 90-day intervention identifying super-utilizers reduced the monthly rate of 9-1-1 calls, ED visits, and hospital admissions.

AB The aim is to explore the effects of antecedent, structural and process quality indicators of nutritional care practice on meal satisfaction and screened nutritional status among older adults in residential care homes.
   Data for this Swedish cross-sectional study regarding older adults living in residential care homes were collected by i) a national questionnaire, ii) records from the quality registry Senior Alert, iii) data from an Open Comparison survey of elderly care in 2013/2014. The data represented 1154 individuals in 117 of 290 Swedish municipalities.
   Meal satisfaction (%) and adequate nutritional status, screened by the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form (MNA-SF), were the two outcome variables assessed through their association with population density of municipalities and residents' age, together with 12 quality indicators pertaining to structure and process domains in the Donabedian model of care.
   Meal satisfaction was associated with rural and urban municipalities, with the structure quality indicators: local food policies, private meal providers, on-site cooking, availability of clinical/community dietitians, food service dietitians, and with the process quality indicators: meal choice, satisfaction surveys, and 'meal councils'. Adequate nutritional status was positively associated with availability of clinical/community dietitians, and energy and nutrient calculated menus, and negatively associated with chilled food production systems.
   Municipality characteristics and structure quality indicators had the strongest associations with meal satisfaction, and quality indicators with local characteristics emerge as important for meal satisfaction. Nutritional competence appears vital for residents to be well-nourished.

AB ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to explore oral health experiences from the perspective of older adults' living in community dwellings. The two objectives of this study were to identify facilitators and barriers to oral health care, and to determine how utilization of oral health services compares to utilization of other healthcare services.
   MethodologyAn interpretive descriptive methodology was employed with a purposive sample of 12 adults, aged 70 years or older. The inclusion criterion was English-speaking seniors residing in community dwellings. Community dwellings were defined as any housing outside of long-term care or other supportive living facilities. Semi-structured interviews were 30-80 min, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Three researchers participated in the comparative analysis process to develop codes, generate categories, interpret patterns and construct themes.
   ResultsThree central themes surfacing from the data were as follows: life course influences on oral health, transparency in delivery of oral health services and interrelationships between oral health and overall health.
   ConclusionsOlder adults in this study emphasized the value of establishing collaborative and trusting relationships between oral health practitioners and older adults. Oral health practitioners should be clear and transparent when communicating information about oral health costs and be cognizant of different circumstances from childhood to older adulthood that inhibit or promote routine utilization of oral health services. Including oral health services as part of interdisciplinary care teams could help promote understandings of the reciprocal relationship between oral health and general health and improve oral health status for older adults.

AB Background: Age increases risk of stroke and bleeding. Clinical trial data have had relatively low proportions of elderly subjects. We sought to study a Spanish population of octogenarians with atrial fibrillation (AF) by combining different sources of electronic clinical records from an area where all medical centres utilized electronic health record systems.
   Methods: Data was derived from the Galician Healthcare Service information system.
   Results: From 383,000 subjects, AF was coded in 7990 (2.08%), 3640 (45.6%) of whom were >= 80 and 4350 (54.4%) <80. All CHA2DS2-VASc's components were more prevalent in the elderly except for diabetes. Of those >= 80, 2178 (59.8%) were women. Mean CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc was 4.2 +/- 1.1. Distribution of CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc components varied between genders. 2600 (71.4%) were on oral anticoagulant (OA). During a median follow up of 696 days (124.23), all-cause mortality was higher in >= 80 (1011/3640 (27.8%) vs 350/4350 (8.05%) (p < 0.001). There were differences in rate of thromboembolic (TE) and haemorrhagic events (2.3% vs 0.9%, p < 0.01 and 2.5% vs 1.7%, p = 0.01 respectively). In octogenarian, differences between genders were observed with regard to TE, but not in haemorrhagic or all-cause mortality rates. Age, heart failure, non-valvular AF, dementia, and OA were independent predictors of all-cause mortality. In regard to TE, female gender, hypertension, previous TE and OA were independent predictive factors.
   Conclusions: Octogenarians with AF had very different characteristics and outcomes from their younger counterparts. These results also provide reassurance about the effectiveness of OA in preventing TE events and maintaining a reasonable haemorrhagic event rate in the extremely elderly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Responding to high prevalence of hypertension and patients' preference of integrating traditional Chinese medicine for blood pressure control, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension With Sodium Reduction for Chinese Canadian (DASHNa-CC) intervention was newly designed as a culturally sensitive dietary educational intervention to facilitate middle-aged and senior Chinese Canadians' blood pressure control in community. The aim of this study was to report the hypertension prevalence rate according to the data from blood pressure screening events, to describe the characteristics of health service utilization among aged Chinese Canadians, and to report the evaluation of participant satisfaction to the DASHNa-CC intervention. This study was designed as a pilot randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 60. Among 618 Chinese Canadians participated in blood pressure screening events, 54.5% (n = 337) having various levels of hypertension. Across 2 months, 38 (63.3%) participants made a total of 47 visits to see their family physicians; 20 (33.3%) participants consulted their family members 224 times for lifestyle modifications and hypertension self-management. Various forms of Chinese media were frequently used as sources of health care information, and English media were rarely accessed. Participants highly satisfied with the contents, delivery approaches, and integration of traditional Chinese medicine in the intervention. Results indicated that middle-aged and senior Chinese Canadians have high hypertension prevalence and specific characteristics of health service utilization. It is important to implement interventions, which are culturally tailored, language appropriate, using proper technology and incorporating traditional Chinese medicine, in Chinese Canadian community for hypertension control.

AB Background: To address the challenges of the global aging population, the World Health Organization promoted age-friendly communities as a way to foster the development of active aging community initiatives. Accordingly, key components (i.e., policies, services and structures related to the communities' physical and social environments) should be designed to be age-friendly and help all aging adults to live safely, enjoy good health and stay involved in their communities. Although age-friendly communities are believed to be a promising way to help aging Canadians lead healthy and active lives, little is known about which key components best foster positive health, social participation and health equity, and their underlying mechanisms. This study aims to better understand which and how key components of age-friendly communities best foster positive health, social participation and health equity in aging Canadians. Specifically, the research objectives are to:
   1) Describe and compare age-friendly key components of communities across Canada
   2) Identify key components best associated with positive health, social participation and health equity of aging adults
   3) Explore how these key components foster positive health, social participation and health equity
   Methods: A mixed-method sequential explanatory design will be used. The quantitative part will involve a survey of Canadian communities and secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). The survey will include an age-friendly questionnaire targeting key components in seven domains: physical environment, housing options, social environment, opportunities for participation, community supports and healthcare services, transportation options, communication and information. The CLSA is a large, national prospective study representative of the Canadian aging population designed to examine health transitions and trajectories of adults as they age. In the qualitative part, a multiple case study will be conducted in five Canadian communities performing best on positive health, social participation and health equity.
   Discussion: Building on new and existing collaborations and generating evidence from real-world interventions, the results of this project will help communities to promote age-friendly policies, services and structures which foster positive health, social participation and health equity at a population level.

AB The emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) provide a number of services ranging from smart homes to elderly care. With a CPS, a user's (elderly person's) interactions with smart home appliances are sensed, collected, and shared in physical spaces. This interaction is then delivered to cyber spaces for processing in order to monitor energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient cyber-physical smart home system for monitoring the elderly that uses the potential of cloud computing and big data technologies. Given that an elderly person may need assistance with the complex activities of maintaining energy efficiency, a smart multimedia-enabled middle ware assistant is proposed that enables him/her to observe different energy-efficient processes, control smart home appliances through gestures, receive notifications regarding appliance statuses, and share multimedia messages with a community of interest. For data processing, robust and low-dimensional discriminative features are extracted in a server from the data available via sensors and multimedia. Events are also automatically classified in the server to assist care giver decision-making. To save energy, an automatic switch on/off control system using speech or gesture is developed. Keywords are detected from the speech and used as control commands. Experimental results show the encouraging potential of deploying this framework at a large scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Choosing to volunteer one's time in service to another is one of life's selfless endeavors. Social work practice often intersects with volunteers. Many social workers volunteer their time. Yet, when volunteerism is studied from a quantitative framework, findings may overlook what is so special in this prosocial act, the voices of the volunteers. This article reports on the qualitative findings in a pilot mixed methods research study exploring a group of volunteers who chose to assist incapacitated older and disabled adults in their community by acting as their legal guardians. Volunteer legal guardianship may serve as the only guardian option in many localities, and may be greatly needed as our population ages. Qualitative data from 15 first and second individual interviews (n=12) were analyzed using a thematic analysis process. Findings indicated a strong humanitarian and civic interest in helping their neighbors in their community. Moreover, volunteers performed a wide variety of tasks in their capacity as guardians along a continuum related to their professional background and skills, an important finding relative to informing recruitment and retention strategies. Volunteer guardians trained in human service-related professions tended to require little information or support throughout the process. Those without human service training tended to request more information and support. However, many became increasingly independent in the task as their experience and competence grew. Additional implications include an understanding of this previously unexplored volunteer task, which may encourage use of and support training of volunteer guardians in aging and allied services.

AB Objective: Older people with chronic diseases often have complex and interacting needs and require treatment and care from a wide range of professionals and services concurrently. This structured review will identify the components of the chronic care model (CCM) required to support healthcare that transitions seamlessly between hospital and ambulatory settings for people over 65 years of age who have two or more chronic diseases.
   Method: A structured review was conducted by searching six electronic databases combining the terms hospital', ambulatory', elderly', chronic disease' and integration/seamless'. Four articles meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Study setting, objectives, design, population, intervention, CCM components, outcomes and results were extracted and a process of descriptive synthesis applied.
   Results and conclusion: All four studies reported only using a few components of the CCM - such as clinical information sharing, community linkages and supported self-management - to create an integrated health system. The implementation of these components in a health service seemed to improve the seamless transition between hospital and ambulatory settings, health outcomes and patient experiences. Further research is required to explore the effect of implementing all CCM components to support transition of care between hospital and ambulatory services.

AB Background After older adults experience episodes of poor health or are hospitalized, they may not return to premorbid or prehospitalization eating behaviors. Furthermore, poor nutrition increases hospital readmission risk, but evidence-based interventions addressing these risks are limited.
   Objective This pilot study's objective was to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial assessing a post-discharge home-delivered meal program's impact on older adults' nutritional intake and hospital readmissions and to assess patient acceptability and satisfaction with the program. The aims of the study were to evaluate successful recruitment, randomization, and retention of at least 80% of the 24 participants sought; to compare the outcomes of hospital readmission and total daily caloric intake between participants in the intervention and control groups; and to assess patient acceptability and satisfaction with the program.
   Design This study used a two-arm randomized controlled trial design, and baseline data were collected at enrollment; three 24-hour food recalls were collected during the intervention period; and health services utilization and intervention satisfaction was evaluated 45 days post-discharge.
   Participants/setting Twenty-four patients from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital's Acute Care for Elders (ACE) Unit were enrolled from May 2014 to June 2015. They were 65 years or older; at risk for malnutrition; cognitively intact; able to communicate; discharged to a place where the patient or family was responsible for preparing meals; and diagnosed with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute myocardial infarction, or pneumonia. Final analysis included 21 participants.
   Intervention The intervention group received 10 days of home-delivered meals and nutrition education; the control group received usual care and nutrition education.
   Main outcome measures The main outcome was intervention feasibility, measured by recruitment and retention goals. Hospital readmissions, caloric intake, and satisfaction with the intervention were also evaluated.
   Statistical analyses performed Univariate and bivariate parametric statistics were used to evaluate differences between groups. Goals for success were identified to assess feasibility of conducting a full-scale study and outcomes were measured against the goals.
   Results Of the randomized participants, 87.5% were retained for final data collection, indicating that this intervention study is feasible. There were no significant differences between groups for hospital readmissions; however, caloric intake during the intervention period was greater for intervention vs control participants (1,595 vs 1,235; P=0.03). Participants were overwhelmingly satisfied (82% to 100% satisfied or very satisfied) with staff performance, meal quality, and delivery processes.
   Conclusions Conducting a randomized controlled trial to assess outcomes of providing home-delivered meals to older adults after hospital discharge in partnership with a small nonprofit organization is feasible and warrants future research.

AB Background: Community-dwelling consumers of healthcare are increasing, many aging with life-limiting conditions and deteriorating cognition. However, few have had advance care planning discussions or completed documentation to ensure future care preferences are acted upon. This study examines the awareness, attitudes, and experiences of advance care planning amongst older people and unrelated offspring/caregivers of older people residing in the community.
   Methods: Qualitative descriptive research, which included focus groups with older people (55+ years) and older people's offspring/caregivers living in an Australian city and surrounding rural region. Data was analysed using an inductive and comparative approach. Sampling was both convenience and purposive. Participants responded to web-based, newsletter or email invitations from an agency, which aims to support healthcare consumers, a dementia support group, or community health centres in areas with high proportions of culturally and linguistically diverse community-dwellers.
   Results: Eight focus groups were attended by a homogenous sample of 15 older people and 27 offspring/ caregivers, with 43% born overseas. The overarching theme, ` shades of grey': struggles in transition, reflects challenges faced by older people and their offspring/caregivers as older people often erratically transition from independence and capacity to dependence and/or incapacity. Offspring/caregivers regularly struggled with older people's fluctuating autonomy and dependency as older people endeavoured to remain at home, and with conceptualising "best times"to actualise advance care planning with substitute decision maker involvement. Advance care planning was supported and welcomed, x advance care planning literacy was evident. Difficulties planning for hypothetical health events and socio-cultural attitudes thwarting death-related discussions were emphasised. Occasional offspring/caregivers with previous substitute decision maker experience reported distress related to their decisions.
   Conclusions: Advance care planning programs traditionally assume participants are ` planning ready'to legally appoint a substitute decision maker (power of attorney) and record end-of-life treatment preferences in short time frames. This contrasts with how community dwelling older people and offspring/caregivers conceive future care decisions over time. Advance care planning programs need to include provision of information, which supports older people's advance care planning understanding and management, and also supports offspring/caregivers' development of strategies for broaching advance care planning with older people, and preparing for potential substitute decision maker roles. Development and integration of strategies to support older people's decisionmaking when in the ` grey zone', with fluctuating cognitive capacities, needs further consideration. Findings support an advance care planning model with conversations occurring at key points across a person's lifespan.

AB Objective The aim of the present study was to describe the care transition experiences of older people who transfer between subacute and primary care, and to identify factors that influence these experiences. A further aim of the study was to identify ways to enhance the Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) model of care and improve local coordination of services for older people.
   Methods The present study was an exploratory, longitudinal case study involving repeat interviews with 19 patients and carers, patient chart audits and three focus groups with service providers. Interview transcripts were coded and synthesised to identify recurring themes.
   Results Patients and carers experienced care transitions as dislocating and unpredictable within a complex and turbulent service context. The experience was characterised by precarious self-management in the community, floundering with unmet needs and holistic care within the GEM service. Patient and carer attitudes to seeking help, quality and timeliness of communication and information exchange, and system pressure affected care transition experiences.
   Conclusion Further policy and practice attention, including embedding early intervention and prevention, strengthening links between levels of care by building on existing programs and educative and self-help initiatives for patients and carers is recommended to improve care transition experiences and optimise the impact of the GEM model of care.
   What is known about the topic? Older people with complex care needs experience frequent care transitions because of fluctuating health and fragmentation of aged care services in Australia. The GEM model of care promotes multidisciplinary, coordinated care to improve care transitions and outcomes for older people with complex care needs.
   What does this paper add? The present study highlights the crucial role of the GEM service, but found there is a lack of systemised linkages within and across levels of care that disrupts coordinated care and affects care transition experiences. There are underutilised opportunities for early intervention and prevention across the system, including the emergency department and general practice.
   What are the implications for practitioners? Comprehensive screening, assessment and intervention in primary and acute care, formalised transition processes and enhanced support for patients and carers to access timely, appropriate care is required to achieve quality, coordinated care transitions for older people.

AB Introduction: The emergency department (ED) is a potentially harmful environment for older adults with dementia, and rural EDs face unique challenges in providing care to this population. The purpose of this study was to understand safety and harm in rural ED transitional care for community dwelling older adults with dementia from the perspective of healthcare professionals (HCPs).
   Methods: An interpretive, descriptive exploratory design from a social ecological perspective was used. Using purposive and snowball sampling, HCPs were recruited from two rural hospital EDs in two Canadian provinces. Data collection involved participant interviews using a semi-structured interview guide. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed, transcripts coded, and themes identified using constant comparative analysis with thematic coding.
   Results: A total of 12 HCPs, seven from one province and five from the other, participated in the study. HCPs worked directly in the ED or consulted in the ED from hospital-based social work, rehabilitation and community liaison services. Three themes were identified: physical environment (space, design and equipment), work environment (pressure to perform) and practice environment (family, knowledge and processes). A conceptual model was developed to illustrate how HCPs worked to balance safety and harm for older patients with dementia within a milieu created by the overlapping and synergistically interacting environments.
   Conclusions: HCPs in rural EDs working at the interface of hospital and community constantly attempt to balance promoting safety and avoiding harm for older adults with dementia. Participants perceived safety broadly, understanding that the consequences of the milieu were created through an interaction between physical, work and practice environments. These consequences related to the physical, cognitive and emotional wellbeing of older adults with dementia and their caregivers. Within the practice environment, participants identified a 'rural advantage' that was tied to their knowledge of community and the people with dementia and their caregivers who sought care in the participating EDs. However, familiarity can be a double-edged sword and to minimize potential harm healthcare professionals must seek input from caregivers regarding altered functional status, and policies to change triage to include gerontological knowledge and create elder-friendly rural ED environments are needed.

AB This study examined how older adults' living arrangements and poverty status affected their use of in-home health, functional, and out-of-home services over time. Using eight waves of data from the Korea Welfare Panel Study, we employed a logistic mixed-effect model to analyze how poverty and living arrangements affect community-based service use. Living-alone older adults and elder-only couples were more likely than co-residing households to use services. Elder-only couples, when poor, were more likely to use in-home and out-of-home services over time. Understanding predictors of community-based service use over time enables researchers and policymakers to better understand the process of aging-in-place.

TI Is the Australian 75+Health Assessment person-centred? A qualitative
   descriptive study of older people's perceptions
SO AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective. The aim of the present study was to explore the perspectives of older people following their recent participation in a 75+ Health Assessment (75+ HA) and interrogate these perspectives using a person-centred lens.
   Methods. A qualitative descriptive study design was used within a larger study funded by the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute. Nineteen participants from four different general practices in one Australian state described their perceptions of the 75+ HA in a face-to-face interview. Data were then analysed using a qualitative content analysis approach.
   Results. The purpose of the 75+ HA was not well understood by participants. Participant responses reveal that where, when, who and how a primary health professional conducted the 75+ HA affected what older people talked about, the guidance they sought to deal with issues and, in turn, the actioning of issues that were discussed during the 75+ HA.
   Conclusion. To enable older people to make informed decisions about and successfully manage their own health and well being, and to choose when to invite others to act on their behalf, primary health professionals need to ask questions in the 75+ HA within a person-centred mindset. The 75+ HA is an opportunity to ensure older people know why they need support, which ones, and agree to, supports and services they require.
   What is known about the topic? The Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule includes the 75+ HA, developed as a proactive primary care opportunity for general practitioners and practice nurses to identify issues affecting community-dwelling older people's health and well being. The aim of the 75+ HA is to consider a broad range of factors that could affect physical, psychological and social functioning, which, in turn, affects overall health, and the capacity of older people to live independently in the community. Underlying the 75+ HA is the importance of detecting early functional decline to enable healthy aging.
   What does this paper add? There is scant, if any, attention in the literature to the views of consumers who have completed a 75+ HA, especially with regard to whether this opportunity is conducted with a person-centred mindset. This paper addresses this gap. Even after participating in the 75+ HA, most participants were unclear as to the purpose of the assessment, what information had been recorded and what would happen from any concerns identified in the assessment. Comments about the 75+ HA included that it did not ask people about their goals and what comprised their functionality to ensure their independent living.
   What are the implications for practitioners? A person-centred approach requires active collaboration between primary health professionals and older people who are living the process of, and planning for, aging-in-place. Assessments like the 75+ HA can assist in identifying whether older people may be experiencing early signs of functional decline, even if older people self-report living without problems in their home. Practitioners need to ask questions of older people and respond to what they say with a person-centred mindset.

ID TREATMENT RETENTION; TREATMENT MMT; PREDICTORS; USERS; PROGRAM
AB Objectives: To identify medication adherence and its influencing factors among patients of 14 methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) clinics in Xi'an, China.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the National AIDS Information System-Community Methadone Maintenance Treatment. All patients registered in the system were not permitted to take methadone at home without professionals' supervision. Medication adherence was assessed using categorical (ie, dropout or retained) and continuous (ie, treatment time, methadone use time, and percentage of methadone use days) variables. Percentages of methadone use days of >90%, 50% to 90%, or <50% indicated good, moderate, and poor adherence, respectively. Multivariate Cox stepwise regression analysis was used to identify the influencing factors.
   Results: Of the 10,398 patients, 52.2% had dropped out of MMT by December 31, 2013, whereas only 11.8% regularly visited the clinic for daily methadone (ie, >90% methadone use days) during a certain period. Protective factors were older age (>30 years); female sex; having no contact with peer drug users over the past month; no needle-sharing experience; a negative initial morphine urine test; and a higher average daily methadone dose (>20 mg) (P < 0.05). Risk factors were answering "others'' for marital status; being employed; having a lack of stable income; not living with family; answering "others'' for drug use type; frequently engaging in unauthorized drug use during MMT; no readmission; long travel times to the MMT clinic (>30 minutes); having no convenient MMT service time; and being dissatisfied with MMT service (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Based on our findings, multimodal intervention and management programs can be developed to improve poor medication adherence among the MMT patient population.

AB ObjectivesTo examine the effects of home care interventions for frail older people in delaying permanent institutionalization during 6 months of follow-up.
   DesignLongitudinal quasi-experimental research study, part of a larger study called Protocol 3.
   SettingCommunity care in Belgium.
   ParticipantsFrail older adults who received interventions (n = 4,607) and a comparison group of older adults who did not (n = 3,633). Organizations delivering the interventions included participants provided they were aged 65 and older, frail, and at risk of institutionalization. A comparison group was established consisting of frail older adults not receiving any interventions.
   InterventionHome care interventions were identified as single component (occupational therapy (OT), psychological support, night care, day care) or multicomponent. The latter included case management (CM) in combination with OT and psychological support or physiotherapy, with rehabilitation services, or with OT alone.
   MeasurementsThe interRAI Home Care (HC) was completed at baseline and every 6 months. Data from a national database were used to establish a comparison group. Relative risks of institutionalization and death were calculated using Poisson regression for each type of intervention.
   ResultsA subgroup analysis revealed that 1,999 older people had mild impairment, and 2,608 had moderate to severe impairment. Interventions providing only OT and interventions providing CM with rehabilitation services were effective in both subpopulations.
   ConclusionThis research broadens the understanding of the effects of different types of community care interventions on the delay of institutionalization of frail older people. This information can help policy-makers to plan interventions to avoid early institutionalization.

AB Many patients, especially elderly, very often don't inform family physicians about drugs prescribed by other specialist and use a number of preparations to self-medicate. These actions may supply negative consequences in recovery process and can be significantly reduced through the implementation of a well-run pharmaceutical care (PC) in the comtitunity pharmacy. Therefore, it is necessary to design proper PC documentation, which allows for comprehensive gathering information needed to carry out the analysis of relevant factors impacting on the prescribed pharmacotherapy effectiveness. The aim of this study was to develop the proper documentation to conduct PC in community pharmacy and verification of its correctness in the group of elderly patients, who is receiving treatment front family physician and additionally at least two specialized doctors. Also an assessment of PC implementation validity as a specialized service was presented. A study was carried out from January 2014 to June 2015. The research covered 54 elderly (41.0% men and 59.0% women) in Jarocin (Poland). Pharmacist was filling in the designed PC form, which subsequently was analyzed mainly for pharmacotherapy problems. The study indicated that 48.1% of patients were counselled by at least 3 specialists; 66.7% of patients were treated by cardiologist and 55.6% by the ophthalmologist; 75.9% of participants had hypertension. 42.6% of the patients used 10 or more pharmaceuticals and 24.1% took 8 or 9 drugs. Moreover, 20.4% of participants used drugs irregularly and 7.4% of them took too low doses of medications. Additionally, during the pharmacotherapy analysis, very significant and significant drug-drug interactions were noticed (1.1% and 18.4%, respectively). Very significant drug-food interactions occurred in 1.4% cases and significant in 3.3% cases. Total number of detected interactions were 553. The substantial analysis of participants' data allowed for 48 patients selection for pharmaceutical counselling. Six patients were involved into the group where PC process was reasonable. These patients often used 10 or more drugs (p = 0.0026), discontinued using medication without doctor consulting (p = 0.0201) and did not follow up the prescribed pharmacotherapy (p = 0.0351). This study provides new data about implementation of PC in Poland. The designed PC documentation may be helpful for proper analysis of the patient's pharmacotherapy to avoid drug problems and to improve elderly patients' quality of life. This project may contribute to PC implementation in Polish community pharmacy.

AB OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between warfarin treatment and different strata of all-cause mortality risk assessed using the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) based on information collected using the Standardized Multidimensional Assessment Schedule for Adults and Aged Persons (SVaMA) in community-dwelling older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF).
   DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
   SETTING: Older community-dwelling adults who underwent a SVaMA evaluation establishing accessibility to homecare services and nursing home admission from 2005 to 2013 in the Padova Health District, Italy.
   PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals with AF aged 65 and older (N = 1,827).
   MEASUREMENTS: Participants were classified as being at mild (MPI-SVaMA-1), moderate (MPI-SVaMA-2), or severe (MPI-SVaMA-3) risk of mortality using the MPI-SVaMA, a validated prognostic tool based on age, sex, comorbidity, cognitive status, mobility and functional disability, pressure sore risk, and social support. The association between warfarin treatment and mortality was tested using multivariate-and propensity score-adjusted Cox regression models, controlling for age, sex, all SVaMA domains, concomitant diseases, and drug treatments.
   RESULTS: Higher MPI-SVaMA scores were associated with lower rates of warfarin treatment and higher 3-year mortality. After adjustment for propensity score quintiles, warfarin treatment was significantly associated with lower 2-year mortality in individuals with MPI-SVaMA-1 (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-0.82), MPI-SVaMA-2 (HR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.55-0.85), and MPI-SVaMA-3 (HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.44-0.67). Heterogeneity analyses confirmed that the effect of warfarin treatment was not different between MPI-SVaMA groups (P for heterogeneity = .48).
   CONCLUSION: Community-dwelling older adults with AF benefitted from anticoagulation in terms of lower all-cause mortality over a mean follow-up of 2 years, regardless of poor health and functional condition. Although this benefit can be ascribed to the treatment, it may also reflect better overall care.

AB Introduction: The Flinders University Telehealth in the Home (FTH) trial was an action research initiative that introduced and evaluated the impact of telehealth services on palliative care patients living in the community, home-based rehabilitation services for the elderly, and services to the elderly in residential aged care. The aim of this study was to understand the issues encountered during the provision of technology services that supported this trial.
   Methods: A mixed methods approach was undertaken to analyse the roles of information and communication technology (ICT) and clinical staff in design, technology management and training. The data sources were staff observations and documents including job logs, meetings, emails and technology descriptions.
   Results: Use of consumer technology for telehealth required customisation of applications and services. Clinicians played a key role in definition of applications and the embedding of workflow into applications. Usability of applications was key to their subsequent use. Management of design creep and technology services, coupled with support and training for clinicians were important to maintenance of a telehealth service.
   Discussion: In the setting described, an iterative approach to the development of telehealth services to the home using consumer technologies was needed. The efficient management of consumer devices in multiple settings will become critical as telehealth services grow in scale. Effective collaboration between clinical and technical stakeholders and further workforce education in telehealth can be key enablers for the transition of face-to-face care to a telehealth mode of delivery.

AB The social care system of China has come under close scrutiny from policy makers due to the rapid ageing of China's population. Unfortunately, there is very little Chinese research evidence that might be used to plan future service developments. This article is a contribution to filling that gap and it provides essential new information on the expressed demand among older people in China for various community care services. The data are from the 2008 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. According to the characteristics of the dependent variables, we used Binary Logistic Regression Analysis to analyse the need for community care among older people in China. The results show considerable need for such care, but China is still a developing country and there are insufficient resources to fund a Western-style social care system (even if that was desirable). Thus, it is argued that the development of social care in China should emphasise community-based care, in partnership with families, with institutional care as a last resort. In addition, it is argued that China (and other countries) should introduce measures to prevent the demand for social care.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine the sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, and cognitive and functional status associated with baseline prevalence and new need for help taking medication 3 years later and to construct a brief scale indicative of need for help taking medications.
   DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional and 3-year longitudinal study.
   SETTING: Five-county area in north-central Piedmont, North Carolina.
   PARTICIPANTS: Representative community-dwelling sample of black and white individuals aged 65 and older (N = 4,136).
   MEASUREMENTS: Information was obtained in person in participants' homes using structured questionnaires. Health conditions included sensory impairment and self-report of physician-diagnosed conditions. Cognitive status was assessed using the 10-item Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. Functional status was assessed using the three-item Rosow-Breslau scale, the five-item Katz activity of daily living scale, and a modified six-item Older Americans Resources and Services instrumental activities of daily living scale.
   RESULTS: Characteristics associated with need for help taking medications were aged 80 and older, being male, living with others, having four or more chronic conditions, and impaired cognitive or functional status (c-statistic 0.94, 77.1% sensitivity, 87.9% specificity). Predictors of new need for help with medications 3 years later included aged 75 and older at baseline, being male, and impaired cognitive and functional status (c-statistic 0.75).
   CONCLUSION: This brief scale can help identify persons needing help with medications and could be useful in assisting clinicians with medication management.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to explore barriers to and facilitators of diabetes self-management among first-generation Korean-American elderly immigrants with type 2 diabetes in the United States Midwest.
   Background: The number of Korean-American elderly immigrants with type 2 diabetes in the United States is expected to increase because they are at risk of adopting a Western lifestyle.
   Methods: Three focus groups (N = 18) and five individual interviews were conducted with Korean-American elderly immigrants with type 2 diabetes. Demographic characteristics and diabetes-related medical history information were obtained with a questionnaire. All data were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated from Korean into English. Transcripts were analysed using standard content-based analysis.
   Results: Five perceived barriers were identified: the high cost of type 2 diabetes care, language issues, loss of self-control, memory loss and limited access to healthcare resources. Three perceived facilitators were time, seeking information, and family and peer supports.
   Limitations: The convenience samples and small sample size may limit the study.
   Conclusions: The barriers to and facilitators of diabetes self-management identified in this study can be used in the development of more age-and culturally sensitive diabetes interventions and resources.
   Implication for nursing and health policy: Nurses and healthcare providers can use this study's findings to develop patient-centred, age-appropriate and culturally appropriate diabetes interventions. There are urgent needs to train bilingual healthcare providers and staff and to provide translation services for Korean-American elderly immigrants. Finally, communities and social supports within public health policy are urgently needed for this ethnic minority group.

ID SOCIAL-ISOLATION; PERSONAL HEALTH; LONELINESS; PERCEPTIONS; DEMENTIA
AB The aging of the population, especially the increase in the "oldest old," is a remarkable achievement that presents both opportunities and challenges for policymakers, researchers, and society. Although many older adults enjoy relatively good health into their later years, many have one or more chronic conditions or diseases and need help with disease management activities or activities important to independent living. Technology is playing an increasingly important role in the health care arena and is becoming ubiquitous in health management activities. There are a variety of technology applications that can be used to enhance the mobility and quality of life of people who have limitations and help to foster the ability of those with chronic conditions to remain at home. Technology applications can also provide a central role in providing support to family caregivers in terms of enhancing access to information and community resources and connections to formal and informal support services. Monitoring technologies may also allow caregivers to check on the status or activities of their loved one while they are at work or at a distant location. Furthermore, telemedicine applications can aid the ability of care providers to monitor patients and deliver health services. The objective of this article is to highlight the potential role that technology can play in the provision of long-term support for older adults and their families. Challenges and barriers that currently limit the full potential of technology to be realized for these populations will also be discussed. Finally the role of psychological science toward maximizing the potential of technology applications in enhancing long term care and support services will be highlighted.

AB In concert with 6 decennial White House Conferences on Aging, psychologists have considered how developments in psychological science can contribute to the well-being of older Americans. We suggest 5 illustrative areas of psychological research: Advances in neuroscience elucidate ways to promote healthy cognitive aging; associated developments in neuropsychological assessment can help in protecting older Americans with cognitive losses from financial exploitation, abuse, and neglect. Psychological research on decision making and behavioral economics has much to offer to planning for retirement security and reducing vulnerability to financial abuse. Psychological research on self-management and behavior change can contribute importantly to enhancing good health behaviors among older adults; similarly the power of context on behavior can be harnessed in long-term care settings. Psychological research on attitudes and stereotypes gives insight into age bias that can be detrimental to healthy aging. Adaptive technologies and information technologies are beginning to transform assessment in research and clinical settings; technology also holds the promise of improving long-term support for older adults in both institutional and community-based settings. Finally, with 1 in 7 Americans now ages 65 and older, compared with 1 in 11 50 years ago, the psychology workforce-including health services providers and faculty to train those providers-is insufficient to meet the challenge of the aging population.

AB Background-Early intervention with medical and/or coronary revascularization treatment approaches remains the cornerstone of the management of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, several patient groups, especially the elderly, are known to delay seeking prompt medical care after onset of AMI-associated symptoms. Current trends, and factors associated with prolonged prehospital delay among elderly patients hospitalized with AMI, are incompletely understood.
   Methods and Results-Data from a population-based study of patients hospitalized at all 11 medical centers in central Massachusetts with a confirmed AMI on a biennial basis between 2001 and 2011 were analyzed. Information about duration of prehospital delay after onset of acute coronary symptoms was abstracted from hospital medical records. In patients 65 years and older, the overall median duration of prehospital delay was 2.0 hours, with corresponding median delays of 2.0, 2.1, and 2.0 hours in those aged 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years, and in patients 85 years and older, respectively. There were no significant changes over time in median delay times in each of the age strata examined in both crude and multivariable adjusted analyses. A limited number of patient characteristics were associated with prolonged delay in this patient population.
   Conclusions-The results of this community-wide study demonstrate that delay in seeking prompt medical care continues to be a significant problem among elderly patients hospitalized with AMI. The lack of improvement in the timeliness of patients' care-seeking behavior during the years under study remains of considerable clinical and public health concern.

AB This article aims to facilitate optimal management of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by providing information on indications, risk factors, referral guidelines, and treatments and to describe techniques to maximize quality of life (QOL) for people with irreversible vision loss. A review of PubMed and other online databases was performed for peer-reviewed English-language articles from 1980 through August 2012 on visual impairment in elderly adults. Search terms included vision loss, visual impairment, blind, low vision, QOL combined with age-related, elderly, and aging. Articles were selected that discussed vision loss in elderly adults, effects of vision impairment on QOL, and care strategies to manage vision loss in older adults. The ability of primary care physicians (PCPs) to identify early signs of cataracts and AMD in individuals at risk of vision loss is critical to early diagnosis and management of these common age-related eye diseases. PCPs can help preserve vision by issuing aptly timed referrals and encouraging behavioral modifications that reduce risk factors. With knowledge of referral guidelines for soliciting low-vision rehabilitation services, visual aids, and community support resources, PCPs can considerably increase the QOL of individuals with uncorrectable vision loss. By offering appropriately timed referrals, promoting behavioral modifications, and allocating low-vision care resources, PCPs may play a critical role in preserving visual health and enhancing the QOL for the elderly population.

AB Objectives: To examine links between clinical and other characteristics of people with Alzheimer's disease living in the community, likelihood of care home or hospital admission, and associated costs.
   Design: Observational data extracted from clinical records using natural language processing and Hospital Episode Statistics. Statistical analyses examined effects of cognition, physical health, mental health, sociodemographic factors and living circumstances on risk of admission to care home or hospital over 6 months and associated costs, adjusting for repeated observations.
   Setting: Catchment area for South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, provider for 1.2 million people in Southeast London.
   Participants: Every individual with diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease seen and treated by mental health services in the catchment area, with at least one rating of cognition, not resident in care home at time of assessment (n=3075).
   Interventions: Usual treatment.
   Main outcome measures: Risk of admission to, and days spent in three settings during 6-month period following routine clinical assessment: care home, mental health inpatient care and general hospital inpatient care.
   Results: Predictors of probability of care home or hospital admission and/or associated costs over 6 months include cognition, functional problems, agitation, depression, physical illness, previous hospitalisations, age, gender, ethnicity, living alone and having a partner. Patterns of association differed considerably by destination.
   Conclusions: Most people with dementia prefer to remain in their own homes, and funding bodies see this as cheaper than institutionalisation. Better treatment in the community that reduces health and social care needs of Alzheimer's patients would reduce admission rates. Living alone, poor living circumstances and functional problems all raise admission rates, and so major cuts in social care budgets increase the risk of high-cost admissions which older people do not want. Routinely collected data can be used to reveal local patterns of admission and costs.

AB Objectives: Advance knowledge about changes in multiple dimensions of health related quality of life (HRQoL) among older adults receiving long-term services and supports (LTSS) over time and across settings.
   Design: A prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort design.
   Setting: Nursing homes (NHs), assisted living facilities (ALFs), community.
   Participants: A total of 470 older adults who were first-time recipients of LTSS.
   Measurement: Single-item quality-of-life measure assessed every 3 months over 2 years. HRQoL domains of emotional status, functional status, and social support were measured using standardized instruments.
   Results: Multivariable mixed effects model with time varying covariates revealed that quality-of-life ratings decreased over time (P<.001). Quality-of-life ratings were higher among enrollees with fewer depressive symptoms (P<.001), higher general physical function (P<.001), enhanced emotional wellbeing (P<.001), and greater social support (P=.004). Ratings also were higher among those with increased deficits in activities of daily living (P=.02). Ratings were highest among enrollees who received LTSS from ALFs, followed by NHs, then home and community-based services (H&CBS), but only findings between ALFs and H&CBS were statistically significant (P<.001). Finally, ratings tended to decrease over time among enrollees with greater cognitive impairment and increase over time among enrollees with less cognitive impairment (P<.001).
   Conclusions: Findings advance knowledge regarding what is arguably the most important outcome of elderly LTSS recipients: quality of life. Understanding associations between multiple HRQoL domains and quality of life over time and directly from LTSS recipients represents a critical step in enhancing care processes and outcomes of this vulnerable population.

AB Recent critical challenges, including terrorism and an aging workforce, have brought to the attention of U.S. government agencies the need to share their knowledge across and within government organizations. In response to the growing awareness of knowledge sharing in the public sector, data from the Federal Human Capital Survey (FHCS) were utilized to develop and test a social-capital-theory-based extension of the relationship between social capital dimension and knowledge-sharing behavior by looking at the interaction effects between social capital dimensions and information technology (IT). The study also explores whether the social capital dimensions that affect knowledge sharing differ across three managerial levels (nonsupervisoiy, supervisory, and senior executive service). The findings provide insights and management strategies into social capital to stimulate knowledge sharing among employees in organizations. The contributions and implications of the findings are discussed.

AB Objectives: While eHealth - the transfer of health care and health resources via information and communication technologies - has been recognized for increasing access to and quality of health services, not all eHealth interventions have been successful in reaching and engaging patients. eHealth uptake is often stunted by sociotechnical challenges, misalignment between designs and user needs/realities as well as other adoption barriers specific to vulnerable and at-risk populations including immigrants and seniors. This paper is a case study examination of barriers and enablers to using eHealth for chronic disease self-management within British Columbia's immigrant Chinese and Punjabi senior populations. Outlined policy recommendations address the unique challenges these populations face in accessing and using online tools for self-management and health improvement.
   Methods: 896 participants were surveyed at nine Chinese and Punjabi public health education events in British Columbia in 2013 and 2014. The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) and focus groups were used to assess eHealth literacy. Descriptive and ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted on the data sets.
   Results: Findings reveal that age, gender, income and education are significantly related to eHEALS outcomes. Language, accessibility, attitude and cultural barriers compound eHealth literacy barriers in these populations.
   Conclusion: eHealth tools for self-management must be culturally-tailored and designed to serve diverse populations. These tools must be designed to meet users' needs and address their challenges related to language, culture, accessibility, and literacy levels. Partnership with community organizations is an appropriate platform to facilitate eHealth driven knowledge translation within multicultural communities. (C) 2015 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine.

TI Cost-Effectiveness of Including a Nurse Specialist in the Treatment of

AB Objective
   Incontinence is an important health problem. Effectively treating incontinence could lead to important health gains in patients and caregivers. Management of incontinence is currently suboptimal, especially in elderly patients. To optimise the provision of incontinence care a global optimum continence service specification (OCSS) was developed. The current study evaluates the costs and effects of implementing this OCSS for community-dwelling patients older than 65 years with four or more chronic diseases in the Netherlands.
   Method
   A decision analytic model was developed comparing the current care pathway for urinary incontinence in the Netherlands with the pathway as described in the OCSS. The new care strategy was operationalised as the appointment of a continence nurse specialist (NS) located with the general practitioner (GP). This was assumed to increase case detection and to include initial assessment and treatment by the NS. The analysis used a societal perspective, including medical costs, containment products (out-of-pocket and paid by insurer), home care, informal care, and implementation costs.
   Results
   With the new care strategy a QALY gain of 0.005 per patient is achieved while saving (sic)402 per patient over a 3 year period from a societal perspective. In interpreting these findings it is important to realise that many patients are undetected, even in the new care situation (36%), or receive care for containment only. In both of these groups no health gains were achieved.
   Conclusion
   Implementing the OCSS in the Netherlands by locating a NS in the GP practice is likely to reduce incontinence, improve quality of life, and reduce costs. Furthermore, the study also highlighted that various areas of the continence care process lack data, which would be valuable to collect through the introduction of the NS in a study setting.

AB Introduction
   Hypertension is prevalent in the elderly, but treatment is often inadequate, particularly in developing countries. The objective of this study was to explore the role of a community-based program in supporting patients with hypertension in an Indonesian rural community.
   Methods
   A qualitative study comprising observation and in-depth interviews was conducted in an Integrated Health Service Post for the Elderly (IHSP-Elderly) program in Bantul district (Yogyakarta province). Eleven members of IHSP-Elderly program (ie, hypertensive patients), 3 community health workers (CHWs), and 1 district health staff member were interviewed to obtain their views about the role of the IHSP-Elderly program in hypertension management. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results
   CHWs played a prominent role as the gatekeepers of health care in the rural community. In supporting hypertension management, CHWs served members of the IHSP-Elderly program by facilitating blood pressure checks and physical exercise and providing health education. Members reported various benefits, such as a healthier feeling overall, peer support, and access to affordable health care. Members felt that IHSP-Elderly program could do more to provide routine blood pressure screening and improve the process of referral to other health care services.
   Conclusion
   CHWs have the potential to liaise between rural communities and the wider health care system. Their role needs to be strengthened through targeted organizational support that aims to improve delivery of, and referral to, care. Further study is needed to identify the key factors for effective CHW-based programs in rural communities and the incorporation of these programs into the health care system.

AB The social and spatial patterns of ageing population in urban China illuminate the influence of the socioeconomic transformation associated with the dual economic system. Guangzhou, one of China's megacities, is used as a case study in this paper. Data from the 2010 National Census were used to examine the spatial differentiation and the related factors of ageing communities in Guangzhou. Using social area analysis, the study identified six categories of ageing communities: traditional inner-city communities, traditional danwei residential communities, commercial housing ageing communities, danwei compound ageing communities, immigrant ageing communities, and rural ageing communities. The paper analyses the reasons and processes leading to the clustering of the elderly population in each category of areas associated with distinctive spatial patterns of ageing differentiation. These patterns suggest that the socio-spatial differentiation of ageing communities is a joint outcome of urban development, housing policies, personal status and family relationships. The dynamics of both ageing in place and ageing with migration had a dual impact on the spatial, social and ecological patterns of ageing communities. The spatial differentiation of ageing communities in the study area should be taken into account when formulating urban planning and public policies. In addition, a dynamic public facility and service allocation system is also necessary to meet the needs associated with evolving socio-spatial urban restructuring. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background:The availability of hospital services for older adults nationwide is not well understood.Objective:To present the development of the Senior Care Services Scale (SCSS) through: (1) identification of hospital services relevant to the care of older adults; (2) development of a taxonomy classifying these services; and (3) description of prevalence, geographic variation, and trends in service provision in US hospitals over time.Design, Setting, and Participants:A retrospective cohort study of US hospitals in 1999 and 2006 rounds of American Hospital Association Annual Survey of Hospitals (n=4998 and 4831 hospitals, respectively). Exploratory factor analysis was used to create the SCSS, and confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine services over time. The paper reports prevalence of services nationwide.Results:The SCSS consisted of 2 service groups: (1) Inpatient Specialty Care (IP): geriatrics, palliative care, psychiatric geriatrics, pain management, social work, case management, rehabilitation, and hospice; and (2) Postacute Community Care (PA): skilled nursing, intermediate care, other long-term care, assisted living, retirement housing, adult day care, and home health services. Over time, hospitals offered more IP services and fewer PA services. The distribution of services did not mirror the distribution of where older adults reside in the United States.Conclusions:The development of the SCSS provides important information about senior care services before the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The apparent mismatch of hospital services and demographic trends suggests that many US hospitals may not provide a seamless continuum of care for an increasing population of older adults.

AB AimRecent National Aged Care Policy Reforms are directed at streamlining entry into aged care services, building on the challenges associated with developing integrated assessment processes. Such reform is core to achieving a comprehensive, efficient process.
   MethodsHere, we report the first stage of a collaborative project with three regional aged care assessment services to explore how services can better work together and improve the assessment process. Specifically, this paper reports the collection of local demographic and assessment data to describe and compare assessment tools and processes across services.
   ResultsFindings demonstrate the high level of need of those entering the community aged care system; the diversity of tools and processes utilised by the three services; and the high level of duplication and commonality across assessment categories.
   ConclusionsFindings suggest the need for improved service integration to clarify the assessment process for older people and conserve regional aged care workforce.

AB An ageing population is posing a great challenge to Hong Kong. Maintaining health and functional independence among older adults is of utmost importance, and requires the collaborative efforts of multiple health care disciplines from both the private and public sectors. The Reference Framework for Preventive Care for Older Adults, developed by the Task Force on Conceptual Model and Preventive Protocols under the auspices of the Working Group on Primary Care, aims to enhance primary care for this population group. The reference framework emphasises a comprehensive, integrated, and collaborative approach that involves providers of primary care from multiple disciplines. In addition to internet-based information, helpful tools in the form of summary charts and Cue Cards are also produced to facilitate incorporation of recommendations by primary care providers into their daily practice. It is anticipated that wide adoption of the reference framework will contribute to improving older adults' health in our community.

AB Background: Evidence indicates that early detection and management of dementia care can improve outcomes. We assess variations in dementia care based on processes outlined in clinical guidelines by the BC Ministry of Health.
   Method: A population-based retrospective cohort study of community-dwelling seniors using patient-level administrative data in British Columbia, Canada. Guidelines measured: laboratory testing, imaging, prescriptions, complete examination, counseling, and specialist referral.
   Results: Older patients were less likely to receive guideline-consistent medical care. Patients in higher income categories had higher odds of receiving counseling (confidence interval or CI 1.13-153) and referrals (15.1 CI 1.18-1.95) compared with those of lower income. Over a quarter of the cohort received an antipsychotic (28%) or nonrecommended benzodiazepine (26%). Individuals living within "rural" health authorities or of low income were more likely to receive antipsychotic treatment.
   Conclusion: Patterns of inequality by age and income may signal barriers to care, particularly for management of dementia care processes. (C) 2015 The Alzheimer's Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and identify the predictors of depression among community-dwelling Korean American elderly (KAE). Design: A cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological survey using a two-step sampling strategy to obtain a representative community sample. Setting: The authors recruited study participants at religious, service, and business establishments in the KA community (26 churches, 6 senior centers, 2 medical daycare centers, 1 supermarket). Participants: Community-dwelling first-generation KAE (N = 1,118; mean age +/- SD: 70.5 +/- 7.0 years; female: 67.2%). Measurements: Trained bilingual nurses and community health workers interviewed participants face-to-face for demographic information, chronic conditions, and depression using the Korean versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9K). Results: 30.3% of KAEs were classified as having either mild (PHQ-9K score 5-9; N = 218, 19.5%) or clinical depression (PHQ-9K score >= 10; N = 120, 10.8%), respectively. One of seven KAE (N = 164, 14.7%) endorsed thoughts of death or self-injury, but only 63 (5.7%) reported utilizing mental health services. The authors also identified several predictors of depression, including living arrangement (living alone versus living with family/spouse); having chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, digestive disorders, or chronic bronchitis; years of education; and cognitive impairment. Conclusions: The authors' findings reveal a high prevalence of depression among KAE and a low level of mental health service utilization. Because there are urgent needs for culturally and contextually relevant interventions, the authors also discuss the feasibility of community-based interventions to reduce the burden of depression, which should be incorporated into a management system for multiple chronic conditions.

AB Background: Depression is the most common mental health problem in late-life. We need more information about the incidence and prevalence of major and minor syndromes of depression in older people. This will help in service development.
   Aims: To estimate the prevalence of depressive disorders among community resident older people in Kerala, India and to identify factors associated with late-life depression.
   Materials and Methods: Two hundred and twenty community resident older subjects were assessed for depression by clinicians trained in psychiatry. They used a symptom checklist based on International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) Diagnostic criteria for research for Depression and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale for assessment of symptoms. A structured proforma was used to assess sociodemographic characteristics and medical history. The point prevalence of depression was estimated. Univariate analysis and subsequent binary logistic regression were carried out to identify factors associated with depression.
   Results: Prevalence of any ICD-10 (World Health Organization, 1992) depressive episode was 39.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 32.6-45.9). There was significant correlation between depression and female gender (odds ratio [OR] 2.33; 95% CI 1.07-5.06) and history of a significant life event in the previous year (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.27-4.49).
   Conclusion: High prevalence rate of late-life depression is indicative of high burden due to depression among older people in the community. Better awareness among primary care clinicians can result in better detection and management of late-life depression.

ID OLDER-PEOPLE
AB Background: The Flinders Telehealth in the Home trial (FTH trial), conducted in South Australia, was an action research initiative to test and evaluate the inclusion of telehealth services and broadband access technologies for palliative care patients living in the community and home-based rehabilitation services for the elderly at home. Telehealth services at home were supported by video conferencing between a therapist, nurse or doctor, and a patient using the iPad tablet.
   Objective: The aims of this study are to identify which technical factors influence the quality of video conferencing in the home setting and to assess the impact of these factors on the clinical perceptions and acceptance of video conferencing for health care delivery into the home. Finally, we aim to identify any relationships between technical factors and clinical acceptance of this technology.
   Methods: An action research process developed several quantitative and qualitative procedures during the FTH trial to investigate technology performance and users perceptions of the technology including measurements of signal power, data transmission throughput, objective assessment of user perceptions of videoconference quality, and questionnaires administered to clinical users.
   Results: The effectiveness of telehealth was judged by clinicians as equivalent to or better than a home visit on 192 (71.6%, 192/268) occasions, and clinicians rated the experience of conducting a telehealth session compared with a home visit as equivalent or better in 90.3% (489/540) of the sessions. It was found that the quality of video conferencing when using a third generation mobile data service (3G) in comparison to broadband fiber-based services was concerning as 23.5% (220/936) of the calls failed during the telehealth sessions. The experimental field tests indicated that video conferencing audio and video quality was worse when using mobile data services compared with fiber to the home services. As well, statistically significant associations were found between audio/video quality and patient comfort with the technology as well as the clinician ratings for effectiveness of telehealth.
   Conclusions: These results showed that the quality of video conferencing when using 3G-based mobile data services instead of broadband fiber-based services was less due to failed calls, audio/video jitter, and video pixilation during the telehealth sessions. Nevertheless, clinicians felt able to deliver effective services to patients at home using 3G-based mobile data services.

TI Nursing Care Cloud Computing Solution towards Construction of Integrated
   Community Care System
SO FUJITSU SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
AB The population in Japan is aging at an alarming rate. According to the Annual Report on the Aging Society 2014 by the Cabinet Office of Japan, 31.9 million people were aged 65 or older as of October 2013, while the number of people in this age bracket is estimated to reach as high as 38.78 million in 2042. Given this situation, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare aspires to establish an integrated community care system designed to allow elderly citizens to stay in the communities they are attached to and lead dignified, independent lives. An array of laws are in development, such as the Act for Securing Comprehensive Medical and Long-term Care in the Community that was passed in June 2014. The integrated community care system must address the increasing need for maintaining the quality of nursing care against the background of the growing elderly population requiring care at home. At the same time, it needs to establish a system to enhance efficiency in service provision and information-sharing among key players such as physicians and nursing care providers. This paper describes the efforts at Fujitsu to develop an integrated community care system that is built upon a Fujitsu's solution to assist care providers in their service provision and management.

AB Background: Stroke disproportionately kills and disables ethnic minority seniors. Up to 30 % of ischemic strokes in the U.S. can be attributed to physical inactivity, yet most Americans, especially older racial/ethnic minorities, fail to participate in regular physical activity. We are conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test a culturally-tailored community-based walking intervention designed to reduce stroke risk by increasing physical activity among African American, Latino, Chinese, and Korean seniors with hypertension. We hypothesize that the intervention will yield meaningful changes in seniors' walking levels and stroke risk with feasibility to sustain and scale up across the aging services network.
   Methods/Design: In this randomized single-blind wait-list control study, high-risk ethnic minority seniors are enrolled at senior centers, complete baseline data collection, and are randomly assigned to receive the intervention "Worth the Walk" immediately (N = 120, intervention group) or in 90 days upon completion of follow-up data collection (N = 120, control group). Trained case managers employed by the senior centers implement hour-long intervention sessions twice weekly for four consecutive weeks to the intervention group. Research staff blinded to participants' group assignment collect outcome data from both intervention and wait-list control participants 1 and 3-months after baseline data collection. Primary outcome measures are mean steps/day over 7 days, stroke knowledge, and self-efficacy for reducing stroke risk. Secondary and exploratory outcome measures include selected biological markers of health, healthcare seeking, and health-related quality of life. Outcomes will be compared between the two groups using standard analytic methods for randomized trials. We will conduct a formal process evaluation to assess barriers and facilitators to successful integration of Worth the Walk into the aging services network and to calculate estimated costs to sustain and scale up the intervention. Data collection is scheduled to be completed in December 2016.
   Discussion: If this RCT demonstrates superior improvements in physical activity and stroke knowledge in the intervention group compared to the control group and is found to be sustainable and scalable, Worth the Walk could serve as a primary stroke prevention model for racial/ethnic communities across the nation.

AB Caring for Older Adults and Caregivers at Home (COACH) is an innovative care coordination program of the Durham Veteran's Affairs Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, that provides home-based dementia care and caregiver support for individuals with dementia and their family caregivers, including attention to behavioral symptoms, functional impairment, and home safety, on a consultation basis. The objectives of this study were to describe the COACH program in its first 2years of operation, assess alignment of program components with quality measures, report characteristics of program participants, and compare rates of placement outside the home with those of a nontreatment comparison group using a retrospective cohort design. Participants were community-dwelling individuals with dementia aged 65 and older who received primary care in the medical center's outpatient clinics and their family caregivers, who were enrolled as dyads (n=133), and a control group of dyads who were referred to the program and met clinical eligibility criteria but did not enroll (n=29). Measures included alignment with Dementia Management Quality Measures and time to placement outside the home during 12months of follow-up after referral to COACH. Results of the evaluation demonstrated that COACH aligns with nine of 10 clinical process measures identified using quality measures and that COACH delivers several other valuable services to enhance care. Mean time to placement outside the home was 29.6 +/- 14.3weeks for both groups (P=.99). The present study demonstrates the successful implementation of a home-based care coordination intervention for persons with dementia and their family caregivers that is strongly aligned with quality measures.

AB Purpose of the Study: The purpose of this study was to describe prevalence of technology use among adults ages 65 and older, particularly for those with disability and activity-limiting symptoms and impairments.
   Design and Methods: Data from the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study, a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries (N = 7,609), were analyzed. Analysis consisted of technology use (use of e-mail/text messages and the internet) by sociodemographic and health characteristics and prevalence ratios for technology usage by disability status.
   Results: Forty percent of older adults used e-mail or text messaging and 42.7% used the internet. Higher prevalence of technology use was associated with younger age, male sex, white race, higher education level, and being married (all p values <.001). After adjustment for sociodemographic and health characteristics, technology use decreased significantly with greater limitations in physical capacity and greater disability. Vision impairment and memory limitations were also associated with lower likelihood of technology use.
   Implications: Technology usage in U.S. older adults varied significantly by sociodemographic and health status. Prevalence of technology use differed by the type of disability and activity-limiting impairments. The internet, e-mail, and text messaging might be viable mediums for health promotion and communication, particularly for younger cohorts of older adults and those with certain types of impairment and less severe disability.

AB Background/Study Context: This longitudinal study was conducted between 1994 and 2004 in a cohort of southern Taiwan community-living older residents. The study aims to explore the trajectories of disability and how these patterns differed between respondents who survived and those who died during data collection phases; this study also investigated how health status change and social service use predicted the different trajectories of disability.
   Methods: Disability, chronic disease, depression, and social service usage data were collected over six waves. Clusters of disability were used to define a categorical response variable. Baseline levels and new occurrences of chronic disease and depression and the frequency of social service use during this period were chosen as the predictors of disability trajectories.
   Results: Changes in levels of disability during the aging process were identified. Different trajectories clearly reflected heterogeneity within disability clusters and between surviving and nonsurviving respondents. This study highlighted that hypertension and depression were predictors of increased disability among both surviving and nonsurviving respondents, whereas diabetes was only found to be a strong predictor of increased disability for the nonsurviving respondents. In addition, this study found that use of social services such as personal care, homemaker-household, and physical therapy were significantly associated with an increase in disability, whereas use of recreational services seemed to be associated with a decrease in disability.
   Conclusions: These findings identify disability to be a highly dynamic process, which can be characterized into different trajectory clusters (e.g., no, mild, and major disability clusters). A greater awareness of these trajectories could be used to better target strategies to prevent and/or manage disabilities in an aging population.

AB The purpose of the current study was to assess perceptions of CircleRides, a paper prototype of a service website designed to meet older adult transportation needs. Researchers used purposive sampling to conduct two focus groups comprised of older adults to obtain feedback on the CircleRides prototype at the beginning of its iterative design process. One focus group was conducted in a continuing care retirement community (n = 13) and the other in an independent living community for older adults (n = 11). The study assessed perceptions of the CircleRides prototype as well as self-reported older adult transportation preferences and needs. Three themes emerged from the data: (a) trust and concern, (b) socialization, and (c) flexibility and options. Researchers found that participants are interested in transportation options; however, concern exists about trusting a new system or prototype that has not established a reputation. Findings from the current study offer lessons learned for future iterations and for creating transportation prototypes for older adults.

AB Background: Older persons are often poorly served by existing models of community-based primary health care (CBPHC). We sought input from clients, informal caregivers, and health care providers on recommendations for system improvements.
   Methods: Focus group interviews were held with clients, informal caregivers, and health care providers in mid-sized urban and rural communities in Ontario. Data were analyzed using a combination of directed and emergent coding. Results were shared with participants during a series of feedback sessions.
   Results: An extensive list of barriers, facilitators, and recommended health system improvements was generated. Barriers included poor system integration and limited access to services. Identified facilitators were person and family-focused care, self-management resources, and successful collaborative practice. Recommended system improvements included expanding and integrating care teams, supports for system navigation, and development of standardized information systems and care pathways.
   Conclusions: Older adults still experience frustrating obstacles when trying to access CBPHC. Identified barriers and facilitators of improved system integration aligned well with current literature and Wagner's Chronic Care Model. Additional work is needed to implement the recommended improvements and to discern their impact on patient and system outcomes.

AB Background: This study investigates the use of an information and communication technology (Elder Tree) designed for older adults and their informal caregivers to improve older adult quality of life and address challenges older adults face in maintaining their independence (for example, loneliness and isolation, falling, managing medications, driving and transportation).
   Methods/Design: This study, an unblinded randomized controlled trial, will evaluate the effectiveness and cost of Elder Tree. Older adults who are at risk for losing their independence - along with their informal caregivers, if they name them - are randomized to two groups. The intervention group has access to their usual sources of information and communication as well as to Elder Tree for 18 months while the control group uses only their usual sources of information and communication. The primary outcome of the study is older adult quality of life. Secondary outcomes are cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year and the impact of the technology on independence, loneliness, falls, medication management, driving and transportation, and caregiver appraisal and mastery. We will also examine the mediating effect of self-determination theory. We will evaluate the effectiveness of Elder Tree by comparing intervention- and control-group participants at baseline and months 6, 12, and 18. We will use mixed-effect models to evaluate the primary and secondary outcomes, where pretest score functions as a covariate, treatment condition is a between-subjects factor, and the multivariate outcome reflects scores for a given assessment at the three time points. Separate analyses will be conducted for each outcome. Cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year will be compared between the intervention and control groups. Additional analyses will examine the mediating effect of self-determination theory on each outcome.
   Discussion: Elder Tree is a multifaceted intervention, making it a challenge to assess which services or combinations of services account for outcomes in which subsets of older adults. If Elder Tree can improve quality of life and reduce healthcare costs among older adults, it could suggest a promising way to ease the burden that advancing age can place on older adults, their families, and the healthcare system.

   BackgroundCurrently, approximately 1million Australians have diabetes and rates have more than doubled since 1989. Type 2 diabetes mellitus accounts for approximately 85% of diabetes cases. Risk factors include obesity, older age, low socio-economic status, sedentary lifestyle and ethnicity. Older individuals from low socio-economic backgrounds are particularly at risk of both developing and of mismanaging their condition.
   DesignExploratory qualitative design.
   MethodsFocus groups were used to collect data from 22 individuals, aged 40 to more than 70years, with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who were attending local health services for their diabetes care. Focus groups ranged in size from four to eight individuals and all were recorded, transcribed and analysed. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis approach.
   ResultsParticipants described their experiences of managing their diabetes as emotionally, physically and socially challenging. Data analysis revealed four main themes including: (1) diabetes the silent disease; (2) a personal journey (3) the work of managing diabetes; and (4) access to resources and services. Throughout, participants highlighted the impact of diabetes on the family, and the importance of family members in providing support and encouragement to assist their self-management efforts.
   ConclusionsParticipants in this study were generally satisfied with their diabetes care but identified a need for clear simple instruction immediately post-diagnosis, followed by a need for additional informal information when they had gained some understanding of their condition.
   Relevance to clinical practiceFindings reveal a number of unmet information and support needs for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In particular, it is important for healthcare professionals and family members to recognise the significant emotional burden that diabetes imposes, and the type and quantity of information individuals with diabetes prefer. It is also important to consider levels of health literacy in the community when developing diabetes-related information or programmes.

   Carolina: Improving Functional Outcomes and Reducing Cost of Care:
   Preliminary Data
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY

DT Article
DE PACE; standardized plan of care; functional outcomes; cost of care;
   interdisciplinary team
AB The Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) is at a crossroads in its evolution as a community-based alternative to institutionally based nursing home care. Because of their perceived value and cost savings to Medicaid and Medicare, PACE programs are under increasing pressure to expand the numbers of individuals they serve while simultaneously reducing the overall cost of care. During the first 5years of operations, the Elderhaus PACE Program in Wilmington, North Carolina, has reduced use of acute hospital care and skilled nursing home care while demonstrating that 46% of their participants improved and 20% of participants maintained their level of functional independence. It is felt that use of a plan of care organized according to standard domains of function and the quantifiable method of documenting improvement in functional health outcomes represent a critical factor in improved outcomes despite lower use of costly hospital and institutional care. The next step will be to disseminate the plan of care process to other PACE programs and measure its effect on participant functional outcomes and cost of care. The fact that the majority of PACE programs in North Carolina are using an electronic medical record that has the standard domains and quantitative functional measures embedded in the software will facilitate this step. Benchmarks for service use data are already being collected and will be compared with service use after the implementation of the plan of care process.

   socially deprived communities in South Wales
SO PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Eye examinations; Qualitative research; Older people; Barriers
ID GLAUCOMA; DEPRIVATION; ADULTS
AB Objectives: This paper describes research findings that try to understand some of the reasons that prevent older people in deprived communities in South Wales from accessing NHS funded sight tests and leads to a discussion of suitable interventions that seek to improve access to primary eye care services and prevent avoidable sight loss.
   Study design: Data were collected from eight focus groups (n = 63) of mixed gender and ages (60-80+ years), of white origin living in deprived communities in South Wales. Individuals were recruited for the focus groups by extensively publicizing the project, with a range of health and older people's community services and groups such as sheltered housing complexes, stroke support groups and coffee morning groups. The study included people who attended optometry services and people not engaged with services. A purposive sampling technique summarizes the sampling approach taken, an approach which the team utilized to recruit 'information rich' cases, namely individuals, groups and organizations that provided the greatest insight into the research question.
   Methods: Focus groups were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data underwent thematic content analysis and subsequent interpretations were corroborated by expert advisors and a project steering group.
   Results: Cost was perceived as a significant barrier to accessing sight tests, particularly in relation to purchasing glasses. Other barriers included the perceived pressure to buy glasses associated with visits to the optometrists; poor understanding of the purpose of a sight test in a health prevention context and acceptance of deteriorating sight loss due to the ageing process.
   Conclusion: Areas of improvement for the delivery of preventative eye health services to older people are identified, as are areas for reflection on the part of those who work within the eye health industry.

AB Although the need to make health services more accessible to persons who have migrated has been identified, knowledge about health-promotion programs (HPPs) from the perspective of older persons born abroad is lacking. This study explores the design experiences and content implemented in an adapted version of a group-based HPP developed in a researcher-community partnership. Fourteen persons aged 70-83 years or older who had migrated to Sweden from Finland or the Balkan Peninsula were included. A grounded theory approach guided the data collection and analysis. The findings showed how participants and personnel jointly helped raise awareness. The participants experienced three key processes that could open doors to awareness: enabling community, providing opportunities to understand and be understood, and confirming human values and abilities. Depending on how the HPP content and design are being shaped by the group, the key processes could both inhibit or encourage opening doors to awareness. Therefore, this study provides key insights into how to enable health by deepening the understanding of how the exchange of health-promoting messages is experienced to be facilitated or hindered. This study adds to the scientific knowledge base of how the design and content of HPP may support and recognize the capabilities of persons aging in the context of migration.

AB Aims/IntroductionThe present study applied the Wilson-Cleary model of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) by using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to understand the interrelationships among clinical, sociodemographic and psychological characteristics in older people with diabetes.
   Materials and MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study with 452 Chinese older people with diabetes recruited from three primary care clinics. A series of assessments were made, including four instruments: the Chinese version of the Short Form 36 Health Survey, Older American Resources and Services Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire, Rand Mental Health Inventory and Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey; and clinical outcomes (diabetes-related characteristics and physiological data).
   ResultsIn the present study, we identified six patient individual and environmental characteristics, namely, age, sex, physical activity, psychological distress, social support and adequacy of income, that significantly influence HRQOL directly or by way of physical functional status and general health perception.
   ConclusionsImproving social and financial support as well as providing interventions to promote physical activity and to cope with psychological distress in this patient population might be effective to eventually enhance their HRQOL. The present findings add to the literature the underlying complex biological and psychological processes of HRQOL, and take the body of knowledge in HRQOL of older people with diabetes to a theoretical level, and provide insights for development of appropriate strategies to optimize their HRQOL.

AB Background: Population ageing fosters new models of care delivery for older people that are increasingly integrated into existing care systems. In the Netherlands, a primary-care based preventive home visitation programme has been developed for potentially frail community-dwelling older people (aged >= 75 years), consisting of a comprehensive geriatric assessment during a home visit by a practice nurse followed by targeted interdisciplinary care and follow-up over time. A theory-based process evaluation was designed to examine (1) the extent to which the home visitation programme was implemented as planned and (2) the extent to which general practices successfully redesigned their care delivery.
   Methods: Using a mixed-methods approach, the focus was on fidelity (quality of implementation), dose delivered (completeness), dose received (exposure and satisfaction), reach (participation rate), recruitment, and context. Twenty-four general practices participated, of which 13 implemented the home visitation programme and 11 delivered usual care to older people. Data collection consisted of semi-structured interviews with practice nurses (PNs), general practitioners (GPs), and older people; feedback meetings with PNs; structured registration forms filled-out by PNs; and narrative descriptions of the recruitment procedures and registration of inclusion and drop-outs by members of the research team.
   Results: Fidelity of implementation was acceptable, but time constraints and inadequate reach (i.e., the relatively healthy older people participated) negatively influenced complete delivery of protocol elements, such as interdisciplinary cooperation and follow-up of older people over time. The home visitation programme was judged positively by PNs, GPs, and older people. Useful tools were offered to general practices for organising proactive geriatric care.
   Conclusions: The home visitation programme did not have major shortcomings in itself, but the delivery offered room for improvement. General practices received useful tools to redesign their care delivery from reactive towards proactive care, but perceived barriers require attention to allow for sustainability of the home visitation programme over time.

AB Background: A number of reforms have been implemented in Swedish health care to support integrated care for frail older people and to reduce utilization of hospital care by this group. Outcomes and process indicators have been used in pay-for-performance (P4P) schemes by both national and local governments to support developments.
   Objective: To analyse limitations in the use of outcome and process indicators to incentivize integrated care for elderly patients with significant health care needs in the context of primary care.
   Method: Data were collected from the Region Skane county council. Eight primary care providers and associated community services were compared in a ranking exercise based on information from interviews and registered data. Registered data from 150 primary care providers were analysed in regression models.
   Results and conclusion: Both the ranking exercise and regression models revealed important problems related to risk-adjustment, attribution, randomness and measurement fixation when using indicators in P4P schemes and for external accountability purposes. Instead of using indicators in incentive schemes targeting individual providers, indicators may be used for diagnostic purposes and to support development of new knowledge, targeting local systems that move beyond organizational boundaries.

AB Objective: To evaluate effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of Computerised Clinical Decision Support (CCDS) for paramedics attending older people who fall.
   Design: Cluster trial randomised by paramedic; modelling.
   Setting: 13 ambulance stations in two UK emergency ambulance services.
   Participants: 42 of 409 eligible paramedics, who attended 779 older patients for a reported fall.
   Interventions: Intervention paramedics received CCDS on Tablet computers to guide patient care. Control paramedics provided care as usual. One service had already installed electronic data capture.
   Main Outcome Measures: Effectiveness: patients referred to falls service, patient reported quality of life and satisfaction, processes of care.
   Safety: Further emergency contacts or death within one month.
   Cost-Effectiveness: Costs and quality of life. We used findings from published Community Falls Prevention Trial to model cost-effectiveness.
   Results: 17 intervention paramedics used CCDS for 54 (12.4%) of 436 participants. They referred 42 (9.6%) to falls services, compared with 17 (5.0%) of 343 participants seen by 19 control paramedics [Odds ratio (OR) 2.04, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.72]. No adverse events were related to the intervention. Non-significant differences between groups included: subsequent emergency contacts (34.6% versus 29.1%; OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.72); quality of life (mean SF12 differences: MCS -0.74, 95% CI -2.83 to +1.28; PCS -0.13, 95% CI -1.65 to +1.39) and non-conveyance (42.0% versus 36.7%; OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.52). However ambulance job cycle time was 8.9 minutes longer for intervention patients (95% CI 2.3 to 15.3). Average net cost of implementing CCDS was 208 pound per patient with existing electronic data capture, and 308 pound without. Modelling estimated cost per quality-adjusted life-year at 15,000 pound with existing electronic data capture; and 22,200 pound without.
   Conclusions: Intervention paramedics referred twice as many participants to falls services with no difference in safety. CCDS is potentially cost-effective, especially with existing electronic data capture.

AB Background. Nutritional risk and low BMI are common among community-dwelling older adults, but it is unclear what associations these factors have with health services utilization and mortality over long-term follow-up. The aim of this study was to assess prospective associations of nutritional risk and BMI with all-cause, nonsurgical, and surgical hospitalization; nursing home admission; and mortality over 8.5 years.
   Methods. Data are from 1,000 participants in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Study of Aging, a longitudinal, observational study of older black and white residents of Alabama aged 65 and older. Nutritional risk was assessed using questions associated with the DETERMINE checklist. BMI was categorized as underweight (< 18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), class I obese (30.0-34.9), and classes II and III obese (>= 35.0). Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess risk of all-cause, nonsurgical, and surgical hospitalization; nursing home admission; and mortality. Covariates included social support, social isolation, comorbidities, and demographic measures.
   Results. In adjusted models, persons with high nutritional risk had 51% greater risk of all-cause hospitalization (95% confidence interval: 1.14-2.00) and 50% greater risk of nonsurgical hospitalizations (95% confidence interval: 1.11-2.01; referent: low nutritional risk). Persons with moderate nutritional risk had 54% greater risk of death (95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.99). BMI was not associated with any outcomes in adjusted models.
   Conclusions. Nutritional risk was associated with all-cause hospitalizations, nonsurgical hospitalizations, and mortality. Nutritional risk may affect the disablement process that leads to health services utilization and death. These findings point to the need for more attention on nutritional assessment, interventions, and services for community-dwelling older adults.

AB BackgroundIn Japan, the integrated community care system aims to enable people to continue to live in their homes. Based on the concept, one of the activities of a Community General Support Center (CGSC) is to provide preventive intervention based on a Community Support Program. Currently, a Basic Checklist (BC) is sent to elderly people to identify persons appropriate for a Secondary Prevention Program.
   MethodsTo find people who had not responded to the BC, CGSC staff evaluated the files of 592 subjects who had participated in the Kurihara Project to identify activities they cannot do that they did in the past, decreased activity levels at home, loss of interaction with people other than their family, and the need for medical interventions. This information was classified, when applicable, into the following categories: (A) no life concerns'; (B) undecided'; and (C) life concerns'. The relationships between these classifications and clinical information, certified need for long-term care, and items on the BC were examined.
   ResultsThe numbers of subjects in categories A, B, and C were 291, 42, and 186, respectively. Life concerns were related to scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating, global cognitive function, depressive state, and apathy. Most items on the BC were not associated with classification into category C, but 25% of the subjects had life concerns related to these items.
   DiscussionAssessment of life concerns by the CGSC staff has clinical validity. The results suggest that there are people who do not respond to the checklist or apply for Long-Term Care Insurance, meaning that they hide' in the community, probably due to apathy or depressive state. To organize a more effective integrated community care system, the CGSC staff should focus mainly on preventive care.

AB Even though there is a constant and accelerating growth of the aging population worldwide, such a rapid rise is negatively impacting available home and community services not able to encompass the necessities associated with the increased number of older people. In particular, there are increasing demands on e-health care services and smart technologies needed for frail elders with chronic diseases and also for those experiencing active aging. Advanced Technology Care Innovation for older persons encompasses all sectors (assistive technology, robotics, home automation, and home care- and institution-based healthcare monitoring, telemedicine) dedicated to promoting health and wellbeing in all types of living environments. Considering that there is a large concern and demand by older persons to remain in familiar social living surroundings, study projects joined with industries have been currently initiated, especially across Europe to improve health and wellbeing. This article will highlight the latest updates in Europe and, in particular in Italy, regarding scientific projects dedicated to unraveling how diverse needs can be translated into an up-to-date technology innovation for the growing elder population. We will provide information regarding advanced technology designed for those with specific geriatric-correlated conditions in familiar living settings and for individuals aging actively. This is an important action because numerous emerging developments are based on user needs identified by geriatricians, thus, underlining the indispensable role of geriatric medicine toward future guidelines on specific technology.

AB Objective: Assessing and monitoring care and service using clinical indicators (CIs) can allow the measurement of and lead to improvements in the quality of care. However, the management and maintenance of CI data has been shown to be difficult because the data are usually collected and provided manually. In this study, for the purpose of efficient managing quality indicators, a data warehouse (DW)-based CI monitoring system was developed. The clinical effectiveness and efficiency of a DW-based CI monitoring was investigated through several case studies of the system's operation at a tertiary hospital.
   Methods: This study analyzed the CIs that have been developed over the past 8 years at a 1340-bed tertiary general university hospital in South Korea to improve and monitor the quality of care and patient safety. The hospital was opened as a fully digital hospital in 2003, and the CIs were computerized in 2005 by implementing a DW-based CI monitoring system. We classified the computerized CIs and evaluated the monitoring results for several representative CIs, such as the optimal prescribing of preventive antibiotics, the average length of stay, the mortality rate, and the rehospitalization rate.
   Results: During the development of the system in 2005, 12 of 19 CIs were computerized, and this number gradually increased until 299 of 335 CIs were computerized by 2012. In addition, among the CIs built computationally through the CI task force team, focal CIs subject to monitoring were selected annually, and the results of this monitoring were shared with all of the staff or the related department and its staff. By providing some examples of our CI monitoring results, we showed the feasibility of improving the quality of care, and maintaining the optimum level of patient care with less labor.
   Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and efficiency as well as the systems operation experience of a DW-based CI monitoring system. These findings may aid medical institutions that plan on computerizing CIs with respect to decision and policy making regarding their systems development and operations.

AB The foreshadowed increase of older people with intellectual disability has become a reality in many developed countries. As these adults age, improved quality of life can be achieved through applications of conjoint policy aims of inclusion and participation. A transition-to-retirement (TTR) program developed for employees of a large multisite disability employment service in Sydney, Australia, used these aims to effect successful partial retirement. The authors describe the program logic of the TTR, detailing its conceptual components as the first step to enabling it to be tested and replicated in other settings. The TTR program has three components: promoting the concept of retirement, laying the groundwork for inclusion of would-be retirees with intellectual disability in the community, and constructing the reality. The third component comprised five stages: planning, locating a group, mapping new routine, recruiting and training mentors, and monitoring and ongoing support. The project's participants were 24 older employees, who replaced 1 day a week of work with membership of a community group and were supported by mentors who facilitated involvement of the participants in their group. Data collected provided information on the implementation of the program, the time and costs expended, and challenges encountered. Key to the model was a coordinator, skilled in generic case management and specific disability interventions (such as active support), who collaborated with others to manage the program. The authors note that by detailing the program logic underpinning the TTR program, they have exposed the hidden work of supporting meaningful inclusion of people with intellectual disability in community groups and added to the limited stock of evidence-informed programs in this area.

AB There are limited studies on the prevalence of epilepsy and co-morbid conditions in older adults with an ID. To begin to address this prevalence of epilepsy was estimated for participants in the Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. Associations with demographic variables and co morbid health conditions were examined. It was found that prevalence was high (30.7%); but declined as people aged. Those with epilepsy were less likely to live with family, independently or in community settings, rates of refractory epilepsy were high and, despite medication over half of those with epilepsy still reported experiencing seizures. Given these findings, people with ID and their careers have considerable needs for information about epilepsy management, and for support from specialist ID and epilepsy services.

AB Several powerful trends are contributing to an aging of much of the world's population, especially in economically developed countries. To mitigate the negative effects of rapidly ageing populations, societies must act early to plan for the welfare, medical care and residential arrangements of their senior citizens, and for the manpower and associated training needed to execute these plans. This paper describes the development of an Ambient Intelligent Community Care Platform (AICCP), which creates an environment of Ambient Intelligence through the use of sensor network and mobile agent (MA) technologies. The AICCP allows caregivers to quickly and accurately locate their charges; access, update and share critical treatment and wellness data; and automatically archive all records. The AICCP presented in this paper is expected to enable caregivers and communities to offer pervasive, accurate and context-aware care services.

TI Health literacy issues in the care of Chinese American immigrants with
   diabetes: a qualitative study
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; COMMUNICATION; ADULTS; NEEDS
AB Objectives: To investigate why first-generation Chinese immigrants with diabetes have difficulty obtaining, processing and understanding diabetes related information despite the existence of translated materials and translators.
   Design: This qualitative study employed purposive sampling. Six focus groups and two individual interviews were conducted. Each group discussion lasted approximately 90 min and was guided by semistructured and open-ended questions.
   Setting: Data were collected in two community health centres and one elderly retirement village in Los Angeles, California.
   Participants: 29 Chinese immigrants aged >= 45 years and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least 1 year.
   Results: Eight key themes were found to potentially affect Chinese immigrants' capacity to obtain, communicate, process and understand diabetes related health information and consequently alter their decision making in self-care. Among the themes, three major categories emerged: cultural factors, structural barriers, and personal barriers.
   Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of cultural sensitivity when working with first-generation Chinese immigrants with diabetes. Implications for health professionals, local community centres and other potential service providers are discussed.

TI Examining the relationship between communities' 'age-friendliness' and
   life satisfaction and self-perceived health in rural Manitoba, Canada

   satisfaction; rural aging

AB Introduction: Population aging is a worldwide phenomenon. As a response, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the concept of 'age-friendliness' in 2006. Age-friendliness is defined in terms of a range of domains, such as housing, opportunities for participation, and transportation. Communities that accommodate the needs of older adults in these domains will, it is thought, promote healthy, active aging. The purpose of the present study was to examine communities' age-friendliness and its relationship to health-related outcomes in a rural context.
   Methods: The study included 29 communities located in Manitoba, a mid-Western Canadian province, that are part of the Province of Manitoba's Age-Friendly Manitoba Initiative. As part of a needs assessment process in these communities, 593 individuals, including seniors and younger adults, completed an Age-Friendly Survey. The survey was designed to measure a variety of features in seven domains (the physical environment, housing options, the social environment, opportunities for participation, community supports and healthcare services, transportation options, and communication and information), as well as containing measures of life satisfaction and self-perceived health. Community characteristics were derived from census data. Moreover, communities were categorized on a rural-urban continuum.
   Results: Multi-level regressions indicated that an overall Age-Friendly Index was positively related to both life satisfaction (b=0.019, p<0.0001) and self-perceived health (b=0.013, p<0.01). When examining more specifically each of the seven age-friendly domains, all but housing was positively related to life satisfaction. Results were not as consistent for self-perceived health, with significant relationships emerging only for the physical environment, social environment, opportunities for participation, and transportation options. A subsequent analysis for seniors versus younger participants, respectively, indicated that significant relationships between age-friendly domains and life satisfaction and self-perceived health were restricted primarily to seniors. None of the community characteristics were related to life satisfaction and self-perceived health, nor was degree of rurality.
   Conclusions: The concept of age-friendliness has been garnering considerable attention from policy-makers as a way to promote healthy aging. For example, in Canada, several provinces have launched age-friendly initiatives. Although causality cannot be inferred from the present, cross-sectional study, the findings are encouraging as they show that age-friendliness is associated with enhanced life satisfaction and self-perceived health in a rural context. The study further supports the notion that a wide range of domains within the community environment are important in older adults' lives and need to be considered. Public policy initiatives, such as the Province of Manitoba's Age-Friendly Initiative, may thus be one approach to enhancing healthy aging in rural settings.

AB Context: High rates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) utilization among older adults are of interest because studies suggest relationships among CAM, self-care, and healthy lifestyle. These potential relationships are of particular interest because of the contribution of self-care in maintaining physical, emotional, and spiritual health as key strategies to successful aging. Naturopathic medicine (NM) is a type of primary care CAM used by older adults, yet little is known about older adults' use of NM or its role in healthy aging.
   Objectives: We sought to examine perceptions about, and utilization of, NM and the experience of addressing health and wellness as part of the aging process.
   Design: Phenomenology-based qualitative inquiry.
   Setting: A total of 13 community-based clinics affiliated with a naturopathic medical school.
   Participants: A total of 47 adults aged 58-100 years.
   Methods: Qualitative analysis of semi-structured focus groups with quantitative analysis of clinical administrative data.
   Results: Over 2543 older adults used NM services affiliated with a natural academic clinic in Seattle in 2011 for diagnoses consistent with primary care: fatigue, anxiety, diabetes, diarrhea, and depression, in rank order. Participants reported they sought NM because it offered a different system of care aligned with their values. Themes included (1) feeling heard, (2) a focus on health education including prevention and self-care, and (3) feeling supported. Themes further distilled into optimal descriptive characteristics of patient-centered providers that may best support older adults' healthy aging. A final theme described barriers to further utilization

TI Development of EASY-Care, for Brief Standardized Assessment of the
   Health and Care Needs of Older People; With Latest Information About
   Cross-National Acceptability
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION

AB Introduction: The EASY-Care system has been developed in the past 20 years in the United States and Europe as a brief standardized method for assessing the perceptions of older people about their health and care needs and priorities for a service response. More recently, it has been adapted and tested for use in poor, middle-income, and rich countries across the world. In this article we review its development and report the latest data for cross-cultural acceptability to older people and their clinicians in 6 countries across 4 continents.
   Method: We used a multicenter, mixed-method (quantitative and qualitative) approach to assess clinician (n = 37) and patient (n = 115) perspectives of acceptability of the EASY-Care Standard (2010) instrument. Data were collected between 2008 and 2012 in Iran, Colombia, India, Lesotho, Tonga, and the United Kingdom.
   Results: Key strengths identified included high levels of acceptability from both clinician and patient perspectives, with the tools seen as useful for identification of unmet need. Key recommendations included enhancing clarity in certain questions, ensuring it is not too long. Recommendations included minor context-specific adaptations, effective use of the screening questionnaire, and use of context-specific interviewer prompts.
   Conclusions: The EASY-Care Standard has high levels of acceptability from both clinicians and patients across poor, middle-income, and rich countries and has the potential to become a global gold standard for holistic person-centered assessment.

TI E-EPR: a workflow-based electronic emergency patient record
SO PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING

DT Article
DE Holistic care workflow; SOA; IHE; Health and social care
ID HEALTH-CARE; INFORMATION
AB Emergency care is, politically and socially, one of the highest priorities in society today. Increasing patient expectations and the advancement of scientific and medical knowledge has had a dramatic effect on the provision of emergency care. Emergency medical services (EMSs) perform pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency care activities, operate 24 h a day/7 days a week and constitute an important link between the community (primary care) and the hospital (secondary and tertiary care). Managing emergency care involves assessing individual needs to create a coordinated plan of care that is consistent with agreed priorities and is designed to bring optimal outcomes using cost-effective care. Emergency care is vital for avoiding death and chronic suffering by the elderly and the homeless, but its overall positive effect on the long-term health and overall well-being of these people can only be improved significantly by applying holistic principles, going beyond basic medical care to offer psychological and social support as far as possible. Thus, creating appropriate emergency care plans requires collaboration and coordination among EMS and social care providers, giving rise to a more holistic approach to emergency care management. In turn, this requires the availability of integrated patient information to authorized individuals of health and social care providers when and where needed. On these grounds, the development of a workflow-based electronic patient record (E-EPR) for emergency care is described which is provided as a service on a cloud. The E-EPR aims at supporting the execution of EMS workflows by providing integrated patient information to EMS process participants and to make this information shareable to health and social care professionals. Due to the heterogeneity of the participating organizations' information systems, the E-EPR is built on top of an Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE)-based collaborative network consisting of EMS agencies and health and social care providers who share patient documents using IHE-based profiles. An experimental implementation of the E-EPR is also described.

TI Medicines management support to older people: understanding the context
   of systems failure
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CARE; ADMISSIONS; TEAMWORK; SAFETY
AB Objectives: Changing demographics and pressures on the healthcare system mean that more older people with complex medical problems need to be supported in primary and community care settings. The challenge of managing medicines effectively in frail elderly patients is considerable. Our research investigates what can go wrong and why, and seeks insight into the context that might set the scene for system failure.
   Setting: North London; a district general hospital and surrounding health authorities.
   Participants: 7 patients who had been admitted to hospital and 16 informants involved in their care.
   Design: Patients with preventable medication-related admissions were identified in an occurrence screening study. An accident investigation approach was used to create case studies from accounts of staff involved in each patient's care prior to their admission. Structured analysis of case studies according to the accident investigation approach was complemented by a separate analysis of interviews using open coding with constant comparison to identify and illustrate higher-level contextual themes.
   Outcomes: The study sheds light on care management problems, their causes and the context in which care management problems and their causes have occurred.
   Results: Care management problems were rooted in issues with decision-making, information support and communications among staff members and between staff, patients and carers. Poor judgement, slips and deviations from best practice were attributed to task overload and complexity. Within general practice, at the interface with community services and with hospitals, we identified disruption to traditional intraprofessional and interprofessional roles, assumptions, channels and media of communication which together created conditions that might compromise patient safety.
   Conclusions: New ways of working driven by the ethos of productivity are disrupting traditional intraprofessional and interprofessional roles, assumptions, channels and media of communication. Concomitant improvements in communications technology, process and protocol are urgently required to offset potentially serious risks to patient safety.

AB Background: Vietnamese patients are disproportionately represented in type 2 diabetes mellitus statistics and also incur high rates of diabetes complications. This situation is compounded by limited access to health care. The aim of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the difficulties Vietnamese patients experience when accessing services and managing their type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to identify factors that are important in promoting health service use.
   Methods: Three focus groups with 15 Vietnamese participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 60 to >70 years of age, were conducted in Vietnamese. Open-ended questions were used and focussed on experiences of living with diabetes and access to healthcare services in the Inner Northwest Melbourne region. Audio recordings were transcribed and then translated into English. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis framework.
   Results: Findings indicate four main themes, which together provide some insight into the experiences of living with diabetes and accessing ongoing care and support, for elderly Vietnamese with type 2 diabetes. Themes included: (1) the value of being healthy; (2) controlling diabetes; (3) staying healthy; and (4) improving services and information access.
   Conclusions: Participants in this study were encouraged to adhere to diabetes self-management principles, based largely on a fear of medical complications. Important aspects of healthcare access were identified as; being treated with respect, having their questions answered and having access to interpreters and information in Vietnamese. Attention to these details is likely to lead to improved access to healthcare services and ultimately to improve glycemic control and overall health status for this community.

ID ACTION PLANS; OUTCOMES; VALIDATION
AB Objective: To determine the association between patient assessment of healthcare delivery and publicly reported asthma performance measures. Methods: We identified individuals 5-50 years old who had asthma quality measures reported to the Minnesota Community Measurement (c) (MCM (c)) by their clinic and sent them a postal survey which included within it the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness care (PACIC), a validated measure of patient perception of the quality of healthcare delivery. We performed a multivariable analysis to examine the association between PACIC scores and achievement of asthma care quality measures. Results: The response rate for the ACS was 102/367 (28%); a non-response bias analysis revealed no differences between responders and non-responders for age, gender and asthma control. Most responders (73%) reported taking asthma medications daily and most (71%) had poorly controlled asthma. The PACIC score was not associated with any of the asthma quality measures based on the data reported to MCM (c) by the clinic. A higher PACIC score was, however, associated with having an asthma action plan based on patient-reported data in the ACS (p<0.0001) but not with patient-reported asthma control or emergency department/hospitalizations for asthma. Conclusions: Patient assessment of high quality asthma care delivery was associated with patient self-report of having an asthma action plan but was not associated with any of the publicly reported asthma performance measures.

AB Background: Despite widespread use, there is little information on the extent and impact of community nursing to patients with type 2 diabetes.
   Objective: To determine the incidence, predictors and costs of community nursing provision to patients with type 2 diabetes in a large community-based representative study of diabetes in an urban Australian setting.
   Design: Prospective observational study utilising data linkage.
   Setting: Postcode defined region in Fremantle, Australia.
   Participants: All patients with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the Fremantle Diabetes Study between 1993 and 1996.
   Methods: Eligible patients were followed from July 1997, when home nursing data first became available, to death or census in November 2007. Home nursing data from the major community nursing service provider were linked with data from the Fremantle Diabetes Study. Cox and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression modelling was used to identify predictors of incident home visits and visit frequency, respectively. Direct costs were estimated from the service provider's unit costs.
   Results: During a mean +/- SD 8.6 +/- 2.9 years of follow-up, 27.8% of 825 patients (aged 65.2 +/- 10.3 years at study entry; 51.2% male) received 21,878 home nursing visits (median frequency 31 [interquartile range 9-85] visits, range 1-1446 visits). In Cox and ZINB models, predictors of home nursing included older age, physical disability measures and macrovascular and microvascular complications. Insulin use was an important predictor of the frequency of visits whilst ethnic and economic factors predicted lower frequency. The estimated cost of home nursing, extrapolated nationally, adds 5% to the total Australian direct health care costs of diabetes.
   Conclusions: Home nursing is frequently utilized in the management of type 2 diabetes with considerable individual variation in the use of this service. Given the associated costs, further research into how home nursing can best be employed is indicated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Community mental health services are regarded as the preferred first tier of specialist psychogeriatric support, with integrated multidisciplinary teams believed to offer improved decision-making and greater continuity of care than separate single-profession services. In England over 400 community mental health teams (CMHTs) form the cornerstone of such support, yet research has neither assessed progress toward integrating key professional disciplines nor the nature of their membership and management arrangements.
   Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was sent to all CMHTs for older people in England, seeking a combination of objective and subjective information on team structure and management.
   Results: Responses from 376 (88%) teams highlighted broader multidisciplinary membership than found in a 2004 survey, with particular growth in the number of support workers and other unqualified practitioners. Only modest progress was found in the integration of psychologists and social workers within CMHTs. The data also revealed a trend toward "core" team membership, and away from "sessional" membership in which staff may have divided loyalties between services. Multidisciplinary working was reported as beneficial by many respondents, but examples of "silo working" were also found, which may have hampered service delivery in a minority of teams.
   Conclusions: The reported growth in the number of practitioners without professional registration raises issues about the appropriate skill mix and substitution within CMHTs, while local agencies should review barriers to the integration of psychologists and social workers. Further research is required to explore the quality of multidisciplinary team working.

TI Variations in Self-Reported Practice of Physicians Providing Clinical
   Care to Individuals with Dementia: A Systematic Review

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine to what extent actual practice as reported in the literature is consistent with clinical guidelines for dementia care.
   DESIGN: A systematic review of empirical studies of clinical services provided by physicians to older adults with a diagnosis of dementia.
   SETTING: All settings involving primary care physicians in which a diagnosis of dementia is provided.
   PARTICIPANTS: Physicians providing care to individuals aged 60 and older with a primary or secondary diagnosis of dementia.
   INTERVENTION: Seven dementia care processes recommended by guidelines: formal memory testing, imaging, laboratory testing, interventions, counseling, community service, and specialist referrals.
   MEASUREMENTS: Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Science Direct, MedLine, PsychINFO, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched for articles in English published before March 1, 2012.
   RESULTS: Twelve studies met the final inclusion criteria, all of which were self-reported cross-sectional surveys. There was broad variation in the proportion of physicians who reported conducting each dementia care process, with the widest variation in formal memory testing (4-96%). Recently published studies reflected a shift in scope of care, reporting that high proportions of physicians provided interventions, counseling, and referrals to specialist.
   CONCLUSION: Despite the availability and dissemination of established best practice guidelines, there is still wide variation in physician practice patterns in dementia care. The quality of currently available studies limits the ability to draw strong conclusions. Better information on practice patterns and their relationship to outcomes for individuals with dementia and their caregivers using more-robust study designs is needed to address the needs of the increasing number of individuals who will require dementia care.

TI Regional gaps in the provision of inpatient rehabilitation services for
   the elderly in Israel: Results of a national survey
SO ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Stroke; Hip fracture; Rehabilitation; Elderly; Health care disparities
ID NIH STROKE SCALE; HIP FRACTURE; POSTACUTE REHABILITATION; HOSPITAL
   DISPOSITION; CARE; GUIDELINES; DISPARITIES; MANAGEMENT; PATIENT
AB Background: Medical events, such as stroke, limb fractures, joint replacements and spinal injuries, can lead to acute functional disability at all ages and to chronic disability, especially among the elderly. Rehabilitation is, therefore, essential for the prevention of permanent disability among older individuals. There are international practice guidelines for stroke and hip fracture management, including recommendations that rehabilitation services be an integral part of the provision of treatment in either an inpatient setting or in the community. There are no organized data on provision of rehabilitation services in Israel or on the distribution of these services throughout the country. Such information would be of great assistance in designing these services where they are needed and in making changes in the existing ones where necessary.
   Methods: Patients aged 65 years or older with stroke or hip fracture were identified through one-day surveys conducted in 2009-2010 in all 26 acute care hospitals in Israel. Data on inpatient and ambulatory rehabilitation services were collected from discharge medical summaries, telephone interviews with the patients or their relatives and reports from the healthcare provider. The extent of rehabilitation services was described and the association between receipt of inpatient rehabilitation and the geographic district based on the patients' listed address was examined in a multivariate analysis.
   Results: A total of 570 patients with stroke and 768 patients with hip fracture were identified and interviews were conducted in regards to 421 and 672 respectively. Out of the stroke patients 238(56.5%) received inpatient rehabilitation, 46(10.9%) received ambulatory rehabilitation treatment without inpatient phase and 137 (32.5%) received no rehabilitation. In fracture these rates were 494(73.5%), 96(14.3%) and 82(12.2%) respectively. Patients living in districts with lower availability of rehabilitation beds were less likely to receive inpatient rehabilitation after controlling for patient characteristics.
   Conclusions: Regional disparities in the provision of inpatient rehabilitation care for elderly after an acute episode of stroke or hip fracture were identified and could be partially attributed to the distribution of rehabilitation beds. These findings highlight the need to plan the rehabilitation resources based on the population needs and to routinely monitor the provision of these services.

AB Background: Community services are playing an increasing role in supporting older adults who are discharged from hospital with ongoing non-acute care needs. However, there is a paucity of information regarding how community services are involved in the discharge process of older individuals from hospital into the community.
   Methods: Twenty-nine databases were searched from 1980 to 2012 (inclusive) for relevant primary published research, of any study design, as well as relevant unpublished work (e.g. clinical guidelines) which investigated community services' involvement in the discharge of older individuals from hospital into the community. Data analysis and quality appraisal (using McMaster critical appraisal tools) were undertaken predominately by the lead author. Data was synthesised qualitatively.
   Results: Twelve papers were eligible for inclusion (five randomised controlled trials, four before and after studies and three controlled trials), involving a total of 8440 older adults (>65 years). These papers reported on a range of interventions. During data synthesis, descriptors were assigned to four emergent discharge methods: Virtual Interface Model, In-reach Interface Model, Out-reach Interface Model and Independent Interface Model. In each model, the findings were mixed in terms of health care and patient and carer outcomes.
   Conclusions: It is plausible that each model identified in this systematic review has a role to play in successfully discharging different cohorts of older adults from hospital. Further research is required to identify appropriate population groups for various discharge models and to select suitable outcome measures to determine the effectiveness of these models, considering all stakeholders' involved.

AB What is known and Objective The medication reconciliation process begins by identifying which medicines a patient used before presentation to hospital. This is time-consuming, labour intensive and may involve interruption of clinicians. We sought to identify the availability and accuracy of data held in a national dispensing database, relative to other sources of medication history information. Methods For patients admitted to two acute hospitals in Ireland, a Gold Standard Pre-Admission Medication List (GSPAML) was identified and corroborated with the patient or carer. The GSPAML was compared for accuracy and availability to PAMLs from other sources, including the Health Service Executive Primary Care Reimbursement Scheme (HSE-PCRS) dispensing database. Results Some 1111 medication were assessed for 97 patients, who were median age 74years (range 1892years), median four co-morbidities (range 19), used median 10 medications (range 325) and half (52%) were male. The HSE-PCRS PAML was the most accurate source compared to lists provided by the general practitioner, community pharmacist or cited in previous hospital documentation: the list agreed for 74% of the medications the patients actually used, representing complete agreement for all medications in 17% of patients. It was equally contemporaneous to other sources, but was less reliable for male than female patients, those using increasing numbers of medications and those using one or more item that was not reimbursable by the HSE. What is new and conclusion The HSE-PCRS database is a relatively accurate, available and contemporaneous source of medication history information and could support acute hospital medication reconciliation.

AB Background: Early identification of frailty is important for proactive primary care. Currently, however, there is no consensus on which measure to use. Therefore, we examined whether a Frailty Index (FI), based on ICPC-coded primary care data, and the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) questionnaire identify the same older people as frail.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study of 1,580 patients aged >= 60 years in a Dutch primary care center. Patients received a GFI questionnaire and were surveyed on their baseline characteristics. Frailty-screening software calculated their FI score. The GFI and FI scores were compared as continuous and dichotomised measures.
   Results: FI data were available for 1549 patients (98%). 663 patients (42%) returned their GFI questionnaire. Complete GFI and FI scores were available for 638 patients (40.4%), mean age 73.4 years, 52.8% female. There was a positive correlation between the GFI and the FI (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.544). Using dichotomised scores, 84.3% of patients with a low FI score also had a low GFI score. In patients with a high FI score, 55.1% also had a high GFI score. A continuous FI score accurately predicted a dichotomised GFI score (AUC 0.78, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.82). Being widowed or divorced was an independent predictor of both a high GFI score in patients with a low FI score, and a high FI score in patients with a low GFI score.
   Conclusions: The FI and the GFI moderately overlap in identifying frailty in community-dwelling older patients. To provide optimal proactive primary care, we suggest an initial FI screening in routine healthcare data, followed by a GFI questionnaire for patients with a high FI score or otherwise at high risk as the preferred two-step frailty screening process in primary care.

AB Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use.
   Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital.
   Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users.
   Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and >= 85 years), a black or "other" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income.
   Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users. Computer/Internet training for older adults and computer/Internet use for various purposes need to consider the significant role their social capital can play.

AB Introduction: The home care and services provided to older adults with the same needs are often inadequate and highly varied. Integrated care pathways (ICPs) can resolve these issues. The aim of this study was to develop the content of ICPs to follow-up frail and disabled community-dwelling older people.
   Theory and method: A rigorous process was applied according to a series of steps: identification of desirable characteristics and a theoretical framework; review of evidence-based practices and current practices; and determination of ICPs by an interdisciplinary task team.
   Results: ICPs are intended to prevent specific problems, maximize independence, and promote successful aging. They are organized according to a dynamic process: (1) needs assessment and assessment of risk/protection factors; (2) data-collection summary and goals identification; (3) planning of interventions from a client-centered view; (4) coordination, delivery, and follow-up; and (5) identification of variances, as well as review and adjustment of plans.
   Conclusion: Once computerized, these ICPs will facilitate the exchange of information as well as the clinical decision-making process with a perspective to adequately matching the needs of an individual person with resources that delay or slow the progression of frailty and disability. Once aggregated, the data will also support managers in organizing teamwork and follow-up for clients.

TI Strategic Priorities to Increase Use of Clinical Preventive Services
   Among Older US Adults
SO PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
AB The objective of this project was to obtain professionals' perceptions of system-level strategies with potential to increase use of clinical preventive services (CPS) among adults aged 50 years or older through community settings. Public health, aging services, and medical professionals participated in guided discussions and a modified Delphi process. Priority strategies, determined on the basis of a 70% or higher a priori agreement level, included enhancing community capacity; promoting the design of health information technologies to exchange data between clinical and community settings; promoting care coordination; broadening scope of practice; providing incentives to employers; and eliminating cost-sharing. Findings provide insights about preferences for system-level strategies that align with national and state initiatives to increase CPS use.

AB Background: Falling in older age is a major public health concern due to its costly and disabling consequences. However very few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted in developing countries, in which population ageing is expected to be particularly substantial in coming years. This article describes the design of an RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactorial falls prevention program in reducing the rate of falls in community-dwelling older people.
   Methods/design: Multicentre parallel-group RCT involving 612 community-dwelling men and women aged 60 years and over, who have fallen at least once in the previous year. Participants will be recruited in multiple settings in Sao Paulo, Brazil and will be randomly allocated to a control group or an intervention group. The usual care control group will undergo a fall risk factor assessment and be referred to their clinicians with the risk assessment report so that individual modifiable risk factors can be managed without any specific guidance. The intervention group will receive a 12-week Multifactorial Falls Prevention Program consisting of: an individualised medical management of modifiable risk factors, a group-based, supervised balance training exercise program plus an unsupervised home-based exercise program, an educational/behavioral intervention. Both groups will receive a leaflet containing general information about fall prevention strategies. Primary outcome measures will be the rate of falls and the proportion of fallers recorded by monthly falls diaries and telephone calls over a 12 month period. Secondary outcomes measures will include risk of falling, fall-related self-efficacy score, measures of balance, mobility and strength, fall-related health services use and independence with daily tasks. Data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle. The incidence of falls in the intervention and control groups will be calculated and compared using negative binomial regression analysis.
   Discussion: This study is the first trial to be conducted in Brazil to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention to prevent falls. If proven to reduce falls this study has the potential to benefit older adults and assist health care practitioners and policy makers to implement and promote effective falls prevention interventions.

ID MULTIMEDIA
AB Objective The use of the internet as a source of health information and link to healthcare services has raised concerns about the ability of consumers, especially vulnerable populations such as older adults, to access these applications. This study examined the influence of training on the ability of adults (aged 45+ years) to use the Medicare. gov website to solve problems related to health management. The influence of computer experience and cognitive abilities on performance was also examined.
   Design Seventy-one participants, aged 47-92, were randomized into a Multimedia training, Unimodal training, or Cold Start condition and completed three healthcare management problems.
   Measurement and analyses Computer/internet experience was measured via questionnaire, and cognitive abilities were assessed using standard neuropsychological tests. Performance metrics included measures of navigation, accuracy and efficiency. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, chi(2) and regression techniques.
   Results The data indicate that there was no difference among the three conditions on measures of accuracy, efficiency, or navigation. However, results of the regression analyses showed that, overall, people who received training performed better on the tasks, as evidenced by greater accuracy and efficiency. Performance was also significantly influenced by prior computer experience and cognitive abilities. Participants with more computer experience and higher cognitive abilities performed better.
   Conclusions The findings indicate that training, experience, and abilities are important when using complex health websites. However, training alone is not sufficient. The complexity of web content needs to be considered to ensure successful use of these websites by those with lower abilities.

AB Background/aim Following a stroke, individuals' abilities may not match the demands of their environment and occupations, resulting in compromised occupational performance. The process of adaptation can enable adjustment of the way occupations are performed to achieve occupational mastery. The purpose of this honours study was to investigate and describe older adults' lived experience of occupational adaptation following a stroke. Methods An interpretative phenomenological approach was used. Participants in the community were recruited through Domiciliary Care service co-ordinators. In-depth interviews were conducted with three men and two women, aged 6878years who had experienced a stroke up to 14years ago. Data were analysed using the Colazzi's method to formulate themes. Results Experiencing a stroke is initially a shock to the system' and while your whole life changes', there are still ways to get on and do your best'. The theme your whole life changes' had three subthemes: apprehension and fear', problem solving' and stretching the limitations'. Resilience, motivation and effort are the required qualities for adaptive responses after stroke. Coping strategies identified to facilitate occupational mastery include the use of humour, touch, expressing anger, using self-talk, maintaining hope, having a sense of being fortunate and supportive friends and family. Conclusion These findings support an empowering approach to therapy, facilitating clients to identify and utilise individually appropriate coping strategies to negotiate negative emotions and apprehension and enable the required personal qualities for occupational adaptation.

AB Introduction: Osteoarthritis (OA) has traditionally been considered a condition of older age. However, younger people are also affected by hip and knee OA, often as a result of sporting and work-related injuries. As OA studies have generally focused on older individuals, little is known about the experience of younger adults with hip or knee OA who can face a distinct set of pressures including work responsibilities and parenting roles. This study aims to investigate well-being and work participation among younger people with hip or knee OA, as well as preferences for OA education and support.
   Methods and analysis: 200 people aged 2055 years with a diagnosis of hip and/or knee OA will be recruited for this cross-sectional study. Participants will be recruited from three major public hospitals in the state of Victoria, Australia following screening of orthopaedic outpatient clinic lists and referrals, and through community-based advertisements. A study questionnaire will be mailed to all participants and written informed consent obtained. Validated measures of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), health status, psychological distress and work limitations will be used. Information on health services use will be collected, in addition to information on the perceived utility and accessibility of a range of existing and proposed education and peer support models. HRQoL data will be compared with Australian population norms using independent t tests, and associations between HRQoL, health status, psychological distress, work limitations and demographic factors will be evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Data on the perceived utility and accessibility of education and peer support models will be analysed descriptively.
   Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval for the study has been obtained. The study findings will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and arthritis consumer organisations for broader dissemination, and presented at national and international scientific meetings.

TI Constraints faced by urban poor in managing diabetes care: patients'
   perspectives from South India

   patients' perspective

AB Background: Four out of five adults with diabetes live in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). India has the second highest number of diabetes patients in the world. Despite a huge burden, diabetes care remains suboptimal. While patients (and families) play an important role in managing chronic conditions, there is a dearth of studies in LMIC and virtually none in India capturing perspectives and experiences of patients in regard to diabetes care.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to better understand constraints faced by patients from urban slums in managing care for type 2 diabetes in India.
   Design: We conducted in-depth interviews, using a phenomenological approach, with 16 type 2-diabetes patients from a poor urban neighbourhood in South India. These patients were selected with the help of four community health workers (CHWs) and were interviewed by two trained researchers exploring patients' experiences of living with and seeking care for diabetes. The sampling followed the principle of saturation. Data were initially coded using the NVivo software. Emerging themes were periodically discussed among the researchers and were refined over time through an iterative process using a mind-mapping tool.
   Results: Despite an abundance of healthcare facilities in the vicinity, diabetes patients faced several constraints in accessing healthcare such as financial hardship, negative attitudes and inadequate communication by healthcare providers and a fragmented healthcare service system offering inadequate care. Strongly defined gender-based family roles disadvantaged women by restricting their mobility and autonomy to access healthcare. The prevailing nuclear family structure and inter-generational conflicts limited support and care for elderly adults.
   Conclusions: There is a need to strengthen primary care services with a special focus on improving the availability and integration of health services for diabetes at the community level, enhancing patient centredness and continuity in delivery of care. Our findings also point to the need to provide social services in conjunction with health services aiming at improving status of women and elderly in families and society.

AB Advances in science, technology, and healthcare have contributed to the global growth of an aging population. With a concomitant decline in birth rate, the increasing need for elder care cannot be met effectively by traditional care models as fewer care-givers are available. This study adopted a qualitative research method, and 13 nurses who have experiences in telecare were interviewed in a regional hospital in northern Taiwan. Data were content analyzed to explore nurses' perceptions of telecare services. Five major themes were identified: (1) provision of individualized care, (2) increasing job requirements and stress, (3) working with a collaborative care model, (4) understanding concerns of the elderly, and (5) foreseeing future challenges. The participants identified the advantages of telecare services for the elderly and recognized a new opportunity for health management in the future population and social changes. The use of technology to provide telecare may offer an effective supplement for elder care services.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to report on a qualitative study that explores senior citizen consumers' empowerment through social engagement in third places and their subsequent loyalty to third places.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected via a qualitative research design from four seniors' clubs in Australia using focus groups (12), and participant observation. The data were analyzed using QSR NVivo software using an interpretive approach.
   Findings - Ten themes based on 34 codes were identified in the study, which were grouped to develop a conceptual model of the antecedents and consequences of seniors' empowerment in third places for further testing. The themes under consumer empowerment were important in assisting to understand the significance of place and social engagement within the place to empower seniors with a positive self-image, better access to information and exercise of choices for smarter purchase decisions. The themes under social capital contributed to a better understanding of the ramification of social capital to marketing knowledge. This was particularly so for marketing constructs embedded in community or aggregate level issues such as value co-creation, relationship marketing, customer involvement and related outcomes. Finally the study reports three types of loyalty: cognitive, ultimate and communal loyalty, that underpinned the behavioral, attitudinal and cognitive dimension of loyalty. The findings suggested that consequent to seniors' social capital and feeling of empowerment in third places they display loyalty to the third place.
   Research limitations/implications - The present study has three theoretical implications; first, it extends knowledge into the notion of third place which underlies the broader domain of servicescape. It also extends understanding of the significance of third places in practicing consumer centric marketing through consumer empowerment. The study also contributes to understanding how third places enhance seniors' social capital through social engagement.
   Practical implications - The managerial implications suggested by the findings provide a number of aspects that managers may consider in relation to service places in three key broad categories of customer-firm interest: improve customer patronage through community engagement, improve local business practices via customer-owner friendship, and redesigning spatial settings to deliver meaningful customer experiences.
   Originality/value - This paper uses the concepts of social engagement within customer community in third places for the development of social capital and empowerment. It provides a customer centric focus to servicescape and incorporates recent works on third places, empowerment, social capital and loyalty.

AB Purpose: To illustrate the application of geographic information systems (GIS) as a tool to assess rehabilitation service delivery by presenting results from research recently conducted to assess demand and provision for community rehabilitation service delivery in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Secondary analysis of data obtained from existing sources was used to establish demand and provision profiles for community rehabilitation services. These data were integrated using GIS software. Results: A number of descriptive maps were produced that show the geographical distribution of service provision variables (location of individual rehabilitation health care providers and location of private and publicly funded community rehabilitation clinics) in relation to the distribution of demand variables (location of the general population; location of specific populations (i.e. residents age 65 and older) and distribution of household income). Conclusions: GIS provides a set of tools for describing and understanding the spatial organization of the health of populations and the distribution of health services that can aid the development of health policy and answer key research questions with respect to rehabilitation health services delivery.

AB Background and Aims: For older individuals living in the community with chronic diseases such as heart failure (HF), caregivers may play an important role in medication adherence. This role may be increasingly important as cognition declines. This study aimed to 1) examine the role of caregivers in medication adherence in a complex population of older home care clients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 2) examine the effect of caregiver stress on medication non-adherence. Methods: The interRAI Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAIHC) instrument collects comprehensive information about all individuals receiving long-term home care services in the Canadian province of Ontario. This analysis of secondary data utilized this database to examine the relationship between caregiver residence and stress on medication adherence among a subset of clients with MCI who were over age 75. Results: The prevalence of HF among the sample was 15.5%, while MCI was present in 42.3% of the sample. Among individuals with MCI, having a caregiver at the same residence reduced medication non-adherence. Additionally, caregiver stress was significantly associated with higher rates of non-adherence. Conclusions: MCI can impair medication adherence. The presence of a caregiver at home significantly improves medication adherence in patients with HF and MCI. Supporting caregivers is an important strategy in allowing clinically complex older adults to remain safely at home. (C) 2012, Editrice Kurtis

AB Aim. To report a concept analysis of telecare.
   Background. Lately telecare has become a worldwide, modern way of giving care over distance by means of technology. Other concepts, like telemedicine, e-health, and telehealth, focus on the same topic though the boundaries between them seem to be blurred.
   Data sources. Sources comprise 44 English language research articles retrieved from the database of Medline and Cinahl (1995October 2011).
   Design. Literature Review.
   Method. A principle-based analysis was undertaken through content analysis of the definitions, attributes, preconditions, and outcomes of the concept.
   Results. The attributes are well described according to the use of technology, caring activity, persons involved, and accessibility. Preconditions and outcomes are well described concerning individual and health political needs and benefits. The concept did not hold its boundaries through theoretical integration with the concept of telemedicine and telehealth. The definition of telecare competes with concepts like home-based e-health, telehomecare, telephonecare, telephone-based psychosocial services, telehealth, and telemedicine. Assessment of the definitions resulted in a suggestion of a new definition: Telecare is the use of information, communication, and monitoring technologies which allow healthcare providers to remotely evaluate health status, give educational intervention, or deliver health and social care to patients in their homes.
   Conclusion. The logical principle was assessed to be partly immature, whereas the pragmatical and linguistical principles were found to be mature. A new definition is suggested and this has moved the epistemological principle forward to maturity.

TI Clinical reasoning process underlying choice of teaching strategies: A

AB Background/aim Clinical reasoning, a critical skill influenced by education and practice context, determines how occupational therapists teach transfer skills. Teaching strategies affect intervention efficacy. Although knowledge about the way teaching strategies are chosen could help improve interventions, few studies have considered this aspect. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the clinical reasoning process of occupational therapists underlying the choice of strategies to teach older adults transfer skills. Methods A grounded theory study was carried out with eleven community occupational therapists recruited in six Health and Social Services Centres in Quebec, Canada. Data were collected through observations of teaching situations (n = 31), in-depth semi-structured interviews (n = 12) and memos, and were analysed using constant comparative methods. Memos were also used to raise codes to conceptual categories, leading to an integrative framework. Rigour was assured by following scientific criteria for qualitative studies. Results The integrative framework includes the clinical reasoning process, consisting of eight stages, and its factors of influence. These factors are internal (experiences and elements of personal context) and external (type of transfer, clients' and their environment's characteristics and practice context). Conclusions The clinical reasoning process underlying the choice of strategies to teach transfer skills was conceptualised into an integrative framework. Such a framework supports clinicians' reflective practice, highlights the importance of theory and practice of pedagogy in occupational therapists' education, and encourages consideration and better documentation of the possible influence of practice context on teaching interventions. As such, this integrative framework could improve occupational therapists' transfer skill interventions with older adults.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Background: Geriatric consultation services are generally beneficial in improving the health and well-being of the elderly. We prospectively studied whether the active participation of family physicians (FPs) in the process of geriatric consultation would improve implementation rates and benefit the health care of the elderly. Methods: We carried out a comparative prospective intervention study in three urban academic family medicine clinics. Patients in the control clinics were evaluated by the consultant geriatrician, and a summary of the findings and recommendations were presented to the FP in a brief meeting. In the intervention clinic, the referring FP joined the geriatrician throughout the geriatric assessment. The percentage of implementation of suggested recommendations was evaluated. Information regarding the utilization of health services was provided from computerized data. Results: Of the 212 patients included in the study, 107 were in the intervention group and 105 were controls. The overall rate of implementation was significantly higher for patients in the intervention group (329/445; 73.9%) than for patients in the control group (232/387; 59.9%), P < 0.0001. In the year after the geriatric assessment, those in the intervention group visited the FP less often. Conclusions: A model co-consultation actively involving the FP in the process of assessment of the older patient by the geriatrician improves the degree of implementation of recommendations without an increase in related heath care utilization and costs. This model should be further developed and studied. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2012; : .

TI Boundaries and e-health implementation in health and social care
SO BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING

DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; SERVICE; UK; COMMUNITY; GROWTH; COSTS
AB Background: The major problem facing health and social care systems globally today is the growing challenge of an elderly population with complex health and social care needs. A longstanding challenge to the provision of high quality, effectively coordinated care for those with complex needs has been the historical separation of health and social care. Access to timely and accurate data about patients and their treatments has the potential to deliver better care at less cost.
   Methods: To explore the way in which structural, professional and geographical boundaries have affected e-health implementation in health and social care, through an empirical study of the implementation of an electronic version of Single Shared Assessment (SSA) in Scotland, using three retrospective, qualitative case studies in three different health board locations.
   Results: Progress in effectively sharing electronic data had been slow and uneven. One cause was the presence of established structural boundaries, which lead to competing priorities, incompatible IT systems and infrastructure, and poor cooperation. A second cause was the presence of established professional boundaries, which affect staffs' understanding and acceptance of data sharing and their information requirements. Geographical boundaries featured but less prominently and contrasting perspectives were found with regard to issues such as co-location of health and social care professionals.
   Conclusions: To provide holistic care to those with complex health and social care needs, it is essential that we develop integrated approaches to care delivery. Successful integration needs practices such as good project management and governance, ensuring system interoperability, leadership, good training and support, together with clear efforts to improve working relations across professional boundaries and communication of a clear project vision. This study shows that while technological developments make integration possible, long-standing boundaries constitute substantial risks to IT implementations across the health and social care interface which those initiating major changes would do well to consider before committing to the investment.

AB Background: Older people usually prefer staying at home rather than going into residential care. The Belgian National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance wishes to invest in home care by financing innovative projects that effectively help older people to stay at home longer. In this study protocol we describe the evaluation of 34 home care projects. These projects are clustered according to the type of their main intervention such as case management, night care, occupational therapy at home and psychological/psychosocial support. The main goal of this study is to identify which types of projects have the most effect in delaying institutionalization of frail older persons.
   Methods/design: This is a longitudinal intervention study based on a quasi-experimental design. Researchers use three comparison strategies to evaluate intervention - comparison among different types of projects, comparisons between older persons in the projects and older persons not benefiting from a project but who are still at home and between older persons in the projects and older persons who are already institutionalized. Projects are asked to include clients who are frail and at risk of institutionalization. In the study we use internationally validated instruments such as the interRAI Home Care instrument, the WHO QOL 8 and the Zarit Burden Interview-12. These instruments are filled out at baseline, at exit from the project and 6 months after baseline. Additionally, caregivers have to do a follow-up every 6 months until exit from the project. Criteria to exit the cohort will be institutionalization longer than 3 months and death. The main analysis in the study consists of the calculation of incidence rates, cumulative incidence rates and hazard rates of definitive institutionalization through survival analyses for each type of project.
   Discussion: This research will provide knowledge on the functional status of frail older persons who are still living at home. This is important information to identify determinants of risk for institutionalization. The identification of effective home care projects in delaying institutionalization will be useful to inform and empower home care providers, policy and related decision makers to manage and improve home care services.

AB The key components of caring for the elderly are diet, living, transportation, education, and safety issues, and telemedical systems can offer great assistance. Through the integration of personal to community information technology platforms, we have developed a new Intelligent Comprehensive Interactive Care (ICIC) system to provide comprehensive services for elderly care. The ICIC system consists of six items, including medical care (physiological measuring system, Medication Reminder, and Dr. Ubiquitous), diet, living, transportation, education (Intelligent Watch), entertainment (Sharetouch), and safety (Fall Detection). In this study, we specifically evaluated the users' intention of using the Medication Reminder, Dr. Ubiquitous, Sharetouch, and Intelligent Watch using a modified technological acceptance model (TAM). A total of 121 elderly subjects (48 males and 73 females) were recruited. The modified TAM questionnaires were collected after they had used these products. For most of the ICIC units, the elderly subjects revealed great willingness and/or satisfaction in using this system. The elderly users of the Intelligent Watch showed the greatest willingness and satisfaction, while the elderly users of Dr. Ubiquitous revealed fair willingness in the dimension of perceived ease of use. The old-old age group revealed greater satisfaction in the dimension of result demonstrability for the users of the Medication Reminder as compared to the young-old and oldest-old age groups. The women revealed greater satisfaction in the dimension of perceived ease of use for the users of Dr. Ubiquitous as compared to the men. There were no statistically significant differences in terms of gender, age, and education level in the other dimensions. The modified TAM showed its effectiveness in evaluating the acceptance and characteristics of technologic products for the elderly user. The ICIC system offers a user-friendly solution in telemedical care and improves the quality of care for the elderly.

AB Objective: To report the processes and outcomes of a case study on digital technology, diabetes and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities.
   Design: The qualitative study was based on a literature review, consultations and testing of a framework through workshops and an interactive information session.
   Setting: Consultations, workshops and an information session conducted in western regions of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
   Method: A framework was designed to address the needs of CALD community members to self-manage chronic conditions using innovative digital technology strategies. This was based on the literature review and 20 consultations held with representatives from health service providers and community organizations. The framework was tested with the assistance of the Quang Minh Buddhist Temple through consultations, workshops and an interactive information session about diabetes, YouTube and digital video cameras, in which 38 elderly women from the Vietnamese community participated. A descriptive and thematic analysis of participant feedback was conducted to determine lessons for future practice.
   Results: Participant feedback indicated that the information session achieved its goal of raising awareness of ways to use and access diabetes information using digital technology. However, participants noted areas for enhancement and improvement, including more focused and targeted engagement with peer-led techniques, the digital proficiency of participants and digital technology preferences based on age and cultural background.
   Conclusion: Digital technology was used to improve diabetes awareness information with elderly Vietnamese women, demonstrating the potential for application with others from CALD communities. However, there are continuing challenges in this approach, indicating the need for nuanced community engagement strategies that consider cultural context and familiarity with different kinds of digital technology.

TI Misperceptions of Medicaid Ineligibility Persist among African American
   Caregivers of Alzheimer's Dementia Care Recipients
SO POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID FAMILY CAREGIVERS
AB African American caregivers of the elderly, including those who care for patients with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, remain underserved by Medicaid Assistance Programs. The purpose of this exploratory study was to ascertain to what degree participants in an Alzheimer's Association program that primarily targeted African Americans applied for and received Medicaid assistance, in particular for adult day care, in-home care, and respite care. Secondary data from the Delaware Regional Office of the Alzheimer's Association's 2006 Caregiver Survey of 38 caregivers were reviewed using descriptive, chi-square, and logistic regression analysis. Results indicate that 20 caregivers applied for Medicaid services, 12 of whom were approved. However, 18 caregivers did not apply for Medicaid mainly because they perceived that they would not qualify for benefits, without investigating their eligibility. Clearly more education is needed in African American communities about the eligibility requirements and benefits of Medicaid Assistance Programs because services such as adult day care, in-home care, and respite care have been shown to reduce some of the burden, stress, and strain associated with caring for elderly patients with Alzheimer's dementia. However, a multisystem approach should be used in the outreach and education processes. Finally, the Medicaid application process should be streamlined to make it less cumbersome. More financial and support services are needed by African American caregivers of Alzheimer's care recipients. (Population Health Management 2012;15:174-180)

AB Objectives: The goal was to develop a classification of emergency departments (EDs) based on their organization of services for seniors discharged to the community.
   Methods: This was a secondary analysis of data collected in a survey of key informants (chief physicians and head nurses) in EDs in Quebec on the organization of services for community-dwelling seniors discharged to the community. Organizational characteristics were classified a priori in the following three categories: 1) availability of human resources, 2) care processes, and 3) links to community services. A multifactorial analysis (MFA) was used to analyze the variables by category and globally, thus investigating not only the relationships between variables within each category, but also the relationships between different categories. The authors then proceeded to classify EDs using Ward's method (hierarchical ascendant classification) applied to reduced data dimensions.
   Results: The sample consisted of 103 EDs. Analyses were carried out on data from the 68 (66%) of these EDs that supplied complete data. These 68 EDs did not differ in terms of their size or geographical location from the 35 other departments that supplied incomplete or no data. We identified three groups of EDs: most specialized (with regard to internal staff and care processes) and less community-oriented (n = 12), moderately specialized and less community-oriented (n = 28), and least specialized and more community-oriented (n = 28).
   Conclusions: This classification of EDs with respect to their organization of services for community-welling seniors may be helpful to those planning services, to decision-makers, and to researchers. The three groups of EDs identified in this study represent three types of organizations with differing assets and limitations. The generalizability of these groups to other settings and the implications for patient outcomes should be investigated.

AB The research explores older women's clothing fit and style concerns and their attitudes toward 3D body scanning. A film of the 3D body scanning process was developed as an information source and shown to groups of older women prior to collecting survey and focus group data in 10 different community centers and living facilities in four Midwestern U.S. states. Clothing fit was the most important consideration to participants in making apparel purchasing decisions. Participants addressed the difficulty in finding clothing that fits their body shapes and styles that are appropriate for the aging body. Participants' preferences for using 3D body scanning in the future were also examined. Focus group participants expressed greatest willingness to use 3D body scanning for pattern development services. Future research needs to address older consumer acceptance of emerging technology applications for clothing customization and selection.

TI Psychogeriatric care: building rural community capacity
SO RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE gender and mental health; geriatric psychiatry; mental health;
   psychiatric tertiary care
AB Introduction: Since the late 1980s, British Columbia (BC) Canada has been undergoing a process of regionalization of health services which includes decentralization and the demand for self-sufficiency with respect to caring for people with mental health issues. In BC, regionalization has meant the continued downsizing of its one large provincial psychiatric hospital Riverview, which has resulted in relocating patients from this hospital to cities and towns throughout BC, and the establishment and/or renovation of psychiatric tertiary-care facilities to treat local community members who experience mental ill health. In the context of the relocation of psychiatric tertiary care, communities in northern BC face the specific challenge of having to provide these specialized services in remote settings, not only for people transferred from Riverview, but also for the increasing number of people 'aging-in-place' in a region that has the fastest growth of older adults in BC. Little is known about the capacity of these remote communities to manage change, develop broader models of care, and integrate people with psychogeriatric mental health issues with residents at existing facilities.
   Methods: This study employed a qualitative research design which involved field research in the rural community where people were transferred, and interviews and focus groups with key people involved in the transfer process. In the analysis of the data a gender-based lens was applied to clarify the differing needs and concerns of male and female patients and to attend to possible needs relating to culture and ethnicity.
   Results: The findings illustrate persistent 'hinterland-metropolis' and 'front-line versus administrative staff' tensions, with respect to resource distribution and top-down governance, and demonstrate the need for more transparent and comprehensive planning by health authorities with respect to instituting mental health reforms in a northern context, as well as improved communication between administrative and front-line staff. The research suggests that it is important to attend to the differing needs of women and men in the context of psychogeriatric care, as well as to other factors such as ethnicity and culture, in order to provide appropriate care. Finally, building community capacity to deal with the complex needs of patients is severely hampered not only by facility and regional health authority staff turnover, but also the stresses inherent to working in northern communities which include geographic, social and economic challenges.
   Conclusion: Increased local engagement is a way to identify and address challenges related to relocating psychogeriatric care to northern and remote settings, and to enhance psychogeriatric care provision in similar locales. While provincial and regional level 'big picture' planning is a necessity, study participants highlighted the critical role of local perspective and expertise.

AB Background There is limited information in New Zealand about community pharmacists' perceptions of services that benefit older people. Objectives To explore the perceptions of community pharmacists' of services that benefit older people; the benefits perceived; and the experiences of pharmacists providing such services. Setting Community pharmacies in New Zealand. Methods A cross-sectional purpose-developed survey was carried out of all community pharmacies in New Zealand. This was followed by twenty qualitative telephone interviews of pharmacists identified as providing at least one specialized service. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded for themes using constant comparison. Main outcome measures Community pharmacists' opinions and perceptions in the cross-sectional survey and qualitative interviews. Results Responses were received from pharmacists in 403/905 evaluable pharmacies. All pharmacies provided some baseline services (advice, dispensing of prescriptions, medicines disposal) and 90% provided home deliveries of medicines. Adherence to medicines was supported by compliance packaging (96%), medication review (Medicines Use Review, MUR) (28%), and repeat prescription reminders (27%). Thirty-five percent provided screening (e. g. cholesterol, blood pressure), and 32% provided medicines education to community groups. Compliance packaging and home delivery were thought the services most beneficial for older people, and should help people adhere to their medicines. The 20 pharmacists interviewed by telephone provided 20 different specialized services (median 2, range 1-4). These included MUR, services to residential homes, visiting educators/special clinics, INR monitoring, services to hospices, and flu vaccination. Benefits perceived included improvements in adherence, patient safety, and patient-knowledge of medicines, and convenient access to services. "Patient need'' was a frequent driver of services, and common facilitators for services were having appropriate training/skills, co-operation with health professionals, peer or expert support, sufficient time and funding. A lack of these facilitators were considered barriers as were resistance from general practitioners or the general public, or high set-up costs. Conclusion Community pharmacists in New Zealand perceived they provide a range of services of potential benefit to older people for managing their medicines. Establishing new services requires cooperation from other health professionals, peer support, training, funding and time. Further research into patients' outcomes from new and established services is needed.

   GUIDELINE
AB Background: Research evidence underpins best practice, but is not always used in healthcare. The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework suggests that the nature of evidence, the context in which it is used, and whether those trying to use evidence are helped (or facilitated) affect the use of evidence. Urinary incontinence has a major effect on quality of life of older people, has a high prevalence, and is a key priority within European health and social care policy. Improving continence care has the potential to improve the quality of life for older people and reduce the costs associated with providing incontinence aids.
   Objectives: This study aims to advance understanding about the contribution facilitation can make to implementing research findings into practice via: extending current knowledge of facilitation as a process for translating research evidence into practice; evaluating the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of two different models of facilitation in promoting the uptake of research evidence on continence management; assessing the impact of contextual factors on the processes and outcomes of implementation; and implementing a pro-active knowledge transfer and dissemination strategy to diffuse study findings to a wide policy and practice community.
   Setting and sample: Four European countries, each with six long-term nursing care sites (total 24 sites) for people aged 60 years and over with documented urinary incontinence
   Methods and design: Pragmatic randomised controlled trial with three arms (standard dissemination and two different programmes of facilitation), with embedded process and economic evaluation. The primary outcome is compliance with the continence recommendations. Secondary outcomes include proportion of residents with incontinence, incidence of incontinence-related dermatitis, urinary tract infections, and quality of life. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, then at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the start of the facilitation interventions. Detailed contextual and process data are collected throughout, using interviews with staff, residents and next of kin, observations, assessment of context using the Alberta Context Tool, and documentary evidence. A realistic evaluation framework is used to develop explanatory theory about what works for whom in what circumstances.

TI Inappropriate Medication in a National Sample of US Elderly Patients
   Receiving Home Health Care
SO JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE potentially inappropriate medication; Home health; Beers list
ID POTENTIALLY INAPPROPRIATE; EXPLICIT CRITERIA; OLDER-ADULTS; PREVALENCE
AB BACKGROUND: With substantial morbidity and functional impairment, older patients receiving home health care are especially susceptible to the adverse effects of unsafe or ineffective medications. Home health agencies' medication review and reconciliation services, however, provide an added mechanism of medication safety that could offset this risk.
   OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) among current elderly home health patients in the US.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis using data from the 2007 National Home and Hospice Care Survey.
   SUBJECTS: 3,124 home health patients 65 years of age or older on at least one medication.
   MAIN MEASURES: Prevalence and classification of PIM use and the association between PIM use and patient and home health agency characteristics.
   KEY RESULTS: In 2007, 38% (95% CI: 36-41) of elderly home health patients were taking at least one PIM. Polypharmacy was associated with an increased risk of PIM use; admission to home health care from a nursing home or other sub-acute facility (compared to admission from the community) and a payment source other than Medicare or Medicaid were associated with a decreased risk of PIM use.
   CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PIM use in older home health patients is high despite potential mechanisms for improved safety. Policies to improve the review and reconciliation processes within home health agencies and to improve physician-home health clinician collaboration are likely needed to lower the prevalence of PIM use in older home health patients.

AB Background: It is unclear how many incident patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) referred to nephrologists are presented with information about conservative care as a treatment option and how many plan not to dialyze.
   Study Design: National observational survey study with random-effects logistic regression.
   Setting & Participants: Incident adult and pediatric pre-emptive transplant, dialysis, and conservative-care patients from public and private renal units in Australia, July to September 2009.
   Predictors: Age, sex, health insurance status, language, time known to nephrologist, timing of information, presence of caregiver, unit conservative care pathway, and size of unit.
   Outcomes & Measurements: The 2 main outcome measures were information provision to incident patients about conservative care and initial treatment regardless of planned conservative care.
   Results: 66 of 73 renal units (90%) participated. 10 (15%) had a formal conservative-care pathway. Of 721 incident patients with stage 5 CKD, 470 (65%) were presented with conservative care as a treatment option and 102 (14%) planned not to dialyze; median age was 80 years. Multivariate analysis for information provision showed that patients older than 65 years (OR, 3.40; 95% CI, 1.97-5.87) and those known to a nephrologist for more than 3 months (OR, 6.50; 95% CI, 3.18-13.30) were more likely to receive information about conservative care. Patients with conservative care as planned initial treatment were more likely to be older than 65 years (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.77-12.49) and women (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.23-4.02) than those who started dialysis therapy. Those with private health insurance were less likely to forgo dialysis therapy (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.17-0.98).
   Limitations: Cross-sectional design prohibited longer term outcome measurement. Excluded patients with stage 5 CKD managed in the community.
   Conclusions: 1 in 7 patients with stage 5 CKD referred to nephrologists plans not to dialyze. Comprehensive service provision with integrated palliative care needs to be improved to meet the demands of the aging population. Am J Kidney Dis. 59(3): 419-427.

TI Is My World Getting Smaller? The Challenges of Living with Vision Loss
SO JOURNAL OF VISUAL IMPAIRMENT & BLINDNESS
LA English

   PARTICIPATION; HEALTH; FEAR
AB Introduction: Vision loss influences both basic and instrumental activities of daily living. There is limited information, however, on the relationship between vision loss and leisure activities. The research presented here was part of a larger study that aimed to understand the importance of participation in leisure activities for those with vision loss. This article focuses on one key theme that emerged from the data: the challenge of engaging in leisure activities outside the home for older adults with vision loss.
   Methods: Semistructured interviews and participant observation were used to collect data from 26 adults aged 70 years and older with vision loss. Only those who perceived themselves to be in good or excellent overall health, separate from vision loss, were included.
   Results: Themes that emerged related to limited leisure activities outside the home included both personal and environmental factors, such as challenging physical environments, struggling to "get there," feelings of vulnerability, having decreased energy, and lacking assertiveness.
   Discussion: The results indicated that vision loss is a key factor that limits one's ability to engage in out-of-home activities. There is a mismatch between environmental and personal factors that prevents participation in many activities. Although it appears that the participants chose not to engage in leisure activities outside the home because the activities were not within their competence, it is clear that these decisions were neither easy nor desirable.
   Implications for practitioners: Therapists who provide services to older adults with vision loss should work with their clients to explore ways to facilitate participation in leisure activities in the community. Advocating for features that increase access and participation, addressing safety, exploring ways to conserve energy, and practicing assertive communication are all important components of a comprehensive vision rehabilitation program.

AB Introduction: Approximately 700 000 people in the UK have dementia, rising to 1.2 million by 2050; one-third of people aged over 65 will die with dementia. Good end-of-life care is often neglected, and detailed UK-based research on symptom burden and needs is lacking. Our project examines these issues from multiple perspectives using a rigorous and innovative design, collecting data which will inform the development of pragmatic interventions to improve care.
   Methods and analysis: To define in detail symptom burden, service provision and factors affecting care pathways we shall use mixed methods: prospective cohort studies of people with advanced dementia and their carers; workshops and interactive interviews with health professionals and carers, and a workshop with people with early stage dementia. Interim analyses of cohort data will inform new scenarios for workshops and interviews. Final analysis will include cohort demographics, the symptom burden and health service use over the follow-up period. We shall explore the level and nature of unmet needs, describing how comfort and quality of life change over time and differences between those living in care homes and those remaining in their own homes. Data from workshops and interviews will be analysed for thematic content assisted by textual grouping software. Findings will inform the development of a complex intervention in the next phase of the research programme.
   Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval was granted by National Health Service ethical committees for studies involving people with dementia and carers (REC refs. 12/EE/0003; 12/LO/0346), and by university ethics committee for work with healthcare professionals (REC ref. 3578/001). We shall present our findings at conferences, and in peer-reviewed journals, prepare detailed reports for organisations involved with end-of-life care and dementia, publicising results on the Marie Curie website. A summary of the research will be provided to participants if requested.

AB Pillars for the Care of Older Persons in the Caribbean: A Comprehensive Community-Based Framework (Pillars) is a hybrid of multiple public health frameworks developed through community-based participatory research processes. Health and social service professionals, governmental organizations, elderly persons, and others from across the English-speaking Caribbean countries developed the Pillars framework to address the growing elderly population and with an aim to increase the number of healthy and active years of life. The Pillars framework consists of four interrelated pillars organized across multiple sectors of society: primary care with care management; integrated services coordination; population-based health promotion and disease prevention; and planning and accountability. Pillars is enabled by an envisioned integrated system of information technology that will increase community-based services delivery, interprofessional communication and coordination, and will aggregate data with all identifiers removed for surveillance, planning, forecasting, policy making, evaluation, and research.

AB To present and test an ecological multidimensional model of neighborhood characteristics and examine its relationship to older disability among older adults.
   Indicators of social vulnerability, wealth, violence, storefronts, residential stability, and the presence of physicians, supermarkets, and fast-food establishments for 1,644 of New Jersey's census tracts were derived from sources that include the U.S. Census 2000, Uniform Crime Report for New Jersey, New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Division of Marketing and Development, New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety Division of Alcohol Beverage Control, and Health Resources and Services Administration Geospatial Data Warehouse. Confirmatory factor analyses were used to develop and test a measurement model of neighborhood texture. Structural equation modeling examined the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and disability of persons aged 65-69 years.
   Analyses revealed that distinct dimensions of neighborhoods could be modeled with administrative data and that neighborhood contextual (supermarkets, physicians, storefronts, violence) and compositional (social vulnerability, wealth, residential stability) characteristics were related to the prevalence of disability.
   The use of multiple indicators of neighborhood with good psychometric qualities is critical for advancing knowledge about the mechanisms by which neighborhood characteristics are associated with the health of older people.

AB Background Medication non-adherence can exacerbate disease severity, leading to impairments that interfere with self-care activities in older adults, and, ultimately, death. Elder self-neglect is the most common report to Adult Protective Services (APS) across the USA and is a significant risk factor for early mortality. These individuals often suffer from multiple comorbid diseases that require careful management, but for various reasons they are unwilling or unable to provide themselves with the self-care resources necessary for maintaining health and safety. No studies have assessed whether medication adherence is associated with elder self-neglect.
   Objective The purpose of this study was to assess and describe medication adherence in this population, as well as evaluate associations between medication adherence and cognitive impairment, depression, physical function, and abilities to perform basic and instrumental activities of daily living (BADLs and IADLs).
   Methods A cross-sectional study of 100 community-dwelling adults 65 years of age and older with APS-substantiated elder self-neglect were assessed. In-home comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGAs) were completed and included medication reviews. Information on each medication, including the amount taken from the date dispensed, was collected and used to determine adherence. The criteria for non-adherence were taking <80 or >110 % of at least one medication. The sample was also split into groups of low adherence (<= 29 %), moderate adherence (29-86 %) and high adherence (>= 86 %). Scores. on the CGA measures Mini-Mental State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, Physical Performance Test (PPT) and Kohlman Evaluation of Living Skills were assessed to determine whether cognitive impairment, depression, physical function, and/or ability to perform BADLs and IADLs were associated with non-adherence or low, moderate or high levels of adherence.
   Results Twenty-five per cent of the sample was taking more than seven medications daily. The average rate of adherence was 59 %. Only eight participants (10 %) were adherent to their entire medication regimen, and thus, 90 % were considered non-adherent to at least one medication. The mean number of medications to which individuals were non-adherent was 3.4. The cognitive impairment, depression, physical function and BADL/IADL measures were not statistically associated with medication nonadherence using the cut-points of <80 or >110 %. However, when split into tertiles, the lowest medication adherence level (<= 29 %) was significantly associated with a greater number of medications being consumed and lower objective physical function levels as measured by the PPT.
   Conclusions Medication non-adherence is a very prevalent problem among older adults who are self-neglecting, and higher non-adherence levels were associated with the number of medications being consumed as well as lower physical function. Physicians who find high rates of medication non-adherence in their patients should consider barriers to adherence, including a large number of medications, lower physical function and the possibility of elder self-neglect. Future efforts should focus on studying the underlying reasons for medication non-adherence in larger samples of older adults who are self-neglecting. This would facilitate the development of interventions to reduce medication non-adherence in this population.

   TRENDS
AB I test if selective out-migration of unhealthy seniors explains why disability rates are so much lower for Florida, as compared to the national average. This particular area of research is timely given the significant demographic changes relating to aging. Moreover, this study contributes to the body of literature examining migration with respect to disability and widowhood. Using State Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) and Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA), I create national maps showing disability rates for the following age-groups: 50-59, 60-69, and 70+. After creating maps in ARCGIS and conducting univariate and clustering analysis on mobility disability and personal care limitation, I employ multinomial logit (MNL) analysis to test if individuals with disability are more likely to out-migrate from Florida. The regression analyses lend support to the relaxed Litwak and Longino (The Gerontologist, 27(3): 266-272, 1987) second-move hypothesis, which claims individuals with progressively worse health are more likely to undertake another move to be closer to family and friends. I state "relaxed'' because the data does not allow one to determine the reason for migration-only that migration occurred during the past year. This research informs policy-makers to recognize that elderly in better health may migrate to places such as Arizona and Florida due to amenity-seeking behavior, but unhealthy elderly are more likely to leave these states due to assistance-seeking behavior. This out-migration can place excess demand on health services for the incoming regions, which requires state and local government to ensure resources are in place. Also noteworthy, my results are less likely to be flawed by erroneous age and sex data in the public use microdata samples (IPUMS) since I stack the 2006 and 2007 American Community Survey (ACS). A recent working studies by Alexander et al. (Inaccurate age and sex data in the Census PUMS files: Evidence and implications. Munich: CESifo, 2010) shows inaccuracies in the IPUMS for the 1 and 5% 2000 Census, the 2003-2006 ACS, the 2005-2007 3-year ACS, and the 2004-2009 current population survey (CPS) files.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes of a method to leverage existing home healthcare telemonitoring technology to deliver depression care management (DCM) to both Spanish-and English-speaking elderly homebound recipients of homecare services. Materials and Methods: Three stand-alone, nonprofit community homecare agencies located in New York, Vermont, and Miami participated in this study. Evidence-based DCM was adapted to the telemonitor platform by programming questions and educational information on depression symptoms, antidepressant adherence, and side effects. Recruited patients participated for a minimum of 3 weeks. Telehealth nurses were trained on DCM and received biweekly supervision. On-site trained research assistants conducted in-home research interviews on depression diagnosis and severity and patient satisfaction with the protocol. Results: An ethnically diverse sample of 48 English-and Spanish-onlyspeaking patients participated, along with seven telehealth nurses. Both patients and telehealth nurses reported high levels of protocol acceptance. Among 19 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depression, the mean depression severity was in the "markedly severe" range at baseline and in the "mild" range at follow-up. Conclusions: Results of this pilot support the feasibility of using homecare's existing telemonitoring technology to deliver DCM to their elderly homebound patients. This was true for both English-and Spanish-speaking patients. Preliminary clinical outcomes suggest improvement in depression severity, although these findings require testing in a randomized clinical trial. Implications for the science and service of telehealth-based depression care for elderly patients are discussed.

AB Objective: This study evaluated a large demonstration project of collaborative care of depression at community health centers by examining the role of clinic site on two measures of quality care (early follow-up and appropriate pharmacotherapy) and on improvement of symptoms (score on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 reduced by 50% or <= 5). Methods: A quasi-experimental study examined data on the treatment of 2,821 patients aged 18 and older with depression symptoms between 2006 and 2009 at six community health organizations selected in a competitive process to implement a model of collaborative care. The model's key elements were use of a Web-based disease registry to track patients, care management to support primary care providers and offer proactive follow-up of patients, and organized psychiatric consultation. Results: Across all sites, a plurality of patients achieved meaningful improvement in depression, and in many sites, improvement occurred rapidly. After adjustment for patient characteristics, multivariate logistic regression models revealed significant differences across clinics in the probability of receiving early follow-up (range.34-.88) or appropriate pharmacotherapy (range .27-.69) and in experiencing improvement (.36 to.84). Similarly, after adjustment for patient characteristics, Cox proportional hazards models revealed that time elapsed between first evaluation and the occurrence of improvement differed significantly across clinics (p<.001). Conclusions: Despite receiving similar training and resources, organizations exhibited substantial variability in enacting change in clinical care systems, as evidenced by both quality indicators and outcomes. Sites that performed better on quality indicators had better outcomes, and the differences were not attributable to patients' characteristics. (Psychiatric Services 62:1047-1053, 2011)

AB With data from the 2009 Canadian Community Health Survey-Healthy Aging Cognition Module, five cognitive functioning categories based on normative values that adjust for age, sex and education were created. The two lowest categories were combined to identify seniors (65 or older) without Alzheimer's disease or dementia living in private households, who had low scores on four cognitive tasks: first recall, second recall, semantic fluency, and processing speed. Low income, not living with a spouse or partner, and diabetes were associated with low scores on each task. Heart disease, impairment in instrumental and daily activities, receiving home care, social participation, loneliness, and self-perceived general and mental health were also associated with low cognitive performance, although the associations differed by cognitive task.

TI Classification Tree Model Identifies Home-based Service Needs of
   Japanese Long-term Care Insurance Consumers
SO PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING
LA English
DT Article
DE community assessment; elderly; home health care; long-term care
ID DISABILITIES; CLIENTS; SUPPORT; PEOPLE
AB Objectives
   To clarify care receivers' needs and unmet needs for home help or home nursing services during daytime and/or nighttime hours, and to identify the characteristic of elders who are most likely to need home care services.
   Design and Sample
   We used a chi-squared automatic interaction detection technique to analyze data from 92 care management researchers, who interviewed 280 caregivers.
   Measures
   Demographic information, assessments of the statuses and service needs of elders.
   Results
   We found that care receivers had more unmet needs at night than during the day. Daytime home help was needed by elders who (1) lived alone or (2) lived with just one person and whose primary caregiver was not their wife. Nighttime home help was needed by those who required assistance eating, and whose primary caregiver was male. Daytime home nursing was needed by elders who (1) received medical treatment instead of day care or (2) did not receive medical treatment, but had difficulty eating. Nighttime home nursing was needed by those who had unstable illnesses and whose medical treatments continued during the night.
   Conclusions
   Our findings may help public health nurses assess community needs in order to effectively and efficiently manage health care resources.

TI An Administrative Claims Model for Profiling Hospital 30-Day Mortality

   HEART-FAILURE; US HOSPITALS; OUTCOMES; ISSUES
AB Background: Outcome measures for patients hospitalized with pneumonia may complement process measures in characterizing quality of care. We sought to develop and validate a hierarchical regression model using Medicare claims data that produces hospital-level, risk-standardized 30-day mortality rates useful for public reporting for patients hospitalized with pneumonia.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Retrospective study of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries age 66 years and older with a principal discharge diagnosis of pneumonia. Candidate risk-adjustment variables included patient demographics, administrative diagnosis codes from the index hospitalization, and all inpatient and outpatient encounters from the year before admission. The model derivation cohort included 224,608 pneumonia cases admitted to 4,664 hospitals in 2000, and validation cohorts included cases from each of years 1998-2003. We compared model-derived state-level standardized mortality estimates with medical record-derived state-level standardized mortality estimates using data from the Medicare National Pneumonia Project on 50,858 patients hospitalized from 1998-2001. The final model included 31 variables and had an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.72. In each administrative claims validation cohort, model fit was similar to the derivation cohort. The distribution of standardized mortality rates among hospitals ranged from 13.0% to 23.7%, with 25(th), 50(th), and 75(th) percentiles of 16.5%, 17.4%, and 18.3%, respectively. Comparing model-derived risk-standardized state mortality rates with medical record-derived estimates, the correlation coefficient was 0.86 (Standard Error = 0.032).
   Conclusions/Significance: An administrative claims-based model for profiling hospitals for pneumonia mortality performs consistently over several years and produces hospital estimates close to those using a medical record model.

AB The provision of timely and effective services for older people with health and social care needs is dependent on the collection of accurate assessment information being shared with relevant agencies and accepted by them. This requires an integrated assessment approach capable of spanning the longstanding institutional separation between health and social care agencies present in England. This article considers the extent to which this has been achieved following the introduction of a policy initiative (the Single Assessment Process) that aimed to integrate assessment through the use of shared tools and procedures. The nature of implementation at the local level is considered in relation to national guidance. Indicators of integration include the existence of protocols and agreements, linkage with other processes and settings, joint training programmes, information sharing systems and the nature of professional involvement. Data are derived from a national survey conducted in 2006. Findings suggest that some aspects of the policy have been taken up more than others and that whilst there is commitment to an integrated approach, this has been hampered by disjointed information sharing initiatives and by lack of involvement from some sectors. The issues raised are relevant to future proposals that seek to promote integrated assessment.

AB Introduction and background: Few financial incentives in the United States encourage coordination across the health and social care systems. Supportive Service Programs (SSPs), operating in Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs), attempt to increase access to care and enhance care quality for aging residents. This article presents findings from an evaluation conducted from 2004 to 2006 looking at the feasibility, quality and outcomes of linking health and social services through innovative NORC-SSP and health organization micro-collaborations.
   Methods: Four NORC-SSPs participated in the study by finding a health care organization or community-based physicians to collaborate with on addressing health conditions that could benefit from a biopsychosocial approach. Each site focused on a specific population, addressed a specific condition or problem, and created different linkages to address the target problem. Using a case study approach, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods, this evaluation sought to answer the following two primary questions: 1) Have the participating sites created viable linkages between their organizations that did not exist prior to the study; and, 2) To what extent have the linkages resulted in improvements in clinical and other health and social outcomes?
   Results: Findings suggest that immediate outcomes were widely achieved across sites: knowledge of other sector providers' capabilities and services increased; communication across providers increased; identification of target population increased; and, awareness of risks, symptoms and health seeking behaviors among clients/patients increased. Furthermore, intermediate outcomes were also widely achieved: shared care planning, continuity of care, disease management and self care among clients improved. Evidence of improvements in distal outcomes was also found.
   Discussion: Using simple, familiar and relatively low-tech approaches to sharing critical patient information among collaborating organizations, inter-sector linkages were successfully established at all four sites. Seven critical success factors emerged that increase the likelihood that linkages will be implemented, effective and sustained: 1) careful goal selection; 2) meaningful collaboration; 3) appropriate role for patients/clients; 4) realistic interventions; 5) realistic expectations for implementation environment; 6) continuous focus on outcomes; and, 7) stable leadership. Focused, micro-level collaborations have the potential to improve care, increasing the chance that organizations will undertake such endeavors.

AB Background: The Seniors Health Research Transfer Network (SHRTN) Collaborative is a network of networks that work together to improve the health and health care of Ontario seniors. The collaborative facilitates knowledge exchange through a library service, knowledge brokers (KBs), local implementation teams, collaborative technology, and, most importantly, Communities of Practice (CoPs) whose members work together to identify innovations, translate evidence, and help implement changes.
   This project aims to increase our understanding of knowledge-to-action (KTA) processes mobilized through SHRTN CoPs that are working to improve the health of Ontario seniors. For this research, KTA refers to the movement of research and experience-based knowledge between social contexts, and the use of that knowledge to improve practice. We will examine the KTA processes themselves, as well as the role of human agents within those processes. The conceptual framework we have adopted to inform our research is the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework.
   Methods/design: This study will use a multiple case study design (minimum of nine cases over three years) to investigate how SHRTN CoPs work and pursue knowledge exchange in different situations. Each case will yield a unique narrative, framed around the three PARIHS dimensions: evidence, context, and facilitation. Together, the cases will shed light on how SHRTN CoPs approach their knowledge exchange initiatives, and how they respond to challenges and achieve their objectives. Data will be collected using interviews, document analysis, and ethnographic observation.
   Discussion: This research will generate new knowledge about the defining characteristics of CoPs operating in the health system, on leadership roles in CoPs, and on the nature of interaction processes, relationships, and knowledge exchange mechanisms. Our work will yield a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the success or failure of KTA initiatives, and create a better understanding of how local caregiving contexts interact with specific initiatives. Our participatory design will allow stakeholders to influence the practical usefulness of our findings and contribute to improved health services delivery for seniors.

AB Introduction
   Over the past decade medication review services have been implemented in many countries, including Australia, UK and USA. Although, the attitudes and barriers to the implementation of evidence-based medicine have been investigated, the extent to which medication review recommendations are evidence-based is not known.
   Objective
   To determine (1) the extent to which pharmacist's recommendations during medication review services were consistent with the evidence-based guides at the time of the review; and (2) the nature and extent of drug-related problems (DRPs) and the actions recommended by pharmacists to resolve DRPs.
   Method
   A retrospective review of Home Medicines Review cases performed on 224 community-dwelling older people (65 years or older). The chi-squared test for categorical variables was used to compare the proportion of recommendations that were evidence-based and recommendations for which no evidence could be identified in the most common Australian information sources. DRPs and the actions recommended to resolve the DRPs were classified according to previously employed criteria.
   Results
   Pharmacists made a total of 1114 therapeutic recommendations to general practitioners, of which 964 required supporting pharmacotherapeutic evidence. The majority (94%) of the pharmacists' recommendations were in accordance with the evidence-based guides, as compared with the recommendations for which no evidence could be identified (P < 0.001). Pharmacists reported that 98% of the patients had at least one problem with use of their medication detected.
   Conclusion
   The majority of the actions recommended by pharmacists during the medication review process were consistent with the literature embedded in key Australian information sources. Medication management in older people is complex and challenging, as highlighted by the DRPs identified in 98% of our patients. A suitably trained pharmacist, with full access to the patient, medical record and supporting resources, can help to improve the quality use of medicines in this at-risk population.

AB Background: The use of information and communication technologies in healthcare is seen as essential for high quality and cost-effective healthcare. However, implementation of e-health initiatives has often been problematic, with many failing to demonstrate predicted benefits. This study aimed to explore and understand the experiences of implementers - the senior managers and other staff charged with implementing e-health initiatives and their assessment of factors which promote or inhibit the successful implementation, embedding, and integration of e-health initiatives.
   Methods: We used a case study methodology, using semi-structured interviews with implementers for data collection. Case studies were selected to provide a range of healthcare contexts (primary, secondary, community care), e-health initiatives, and degrees of normalization. The initiatives studied were Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) in secondary care, a Community Nurse Information System (CNIS) in community care, and Choose and Book (C&B) across the primary-secondary care interface. Implementers were selected to provide a range of seniority, including chief executive officers, middle managers, and staff with 'on the ground' experience. Interview data were analyzed using a framework derived from Normalization Process Theory (NPT).
   Results: Twenty-three interviews were completed across the three case studies. There were wide differences in experiences of implementation and embedding across these case studies; these differences were well explained by collective action components of NPT. New technology was most likely to 'normalize' where implementers perceived that it had a positive impact on interactions between professionals and patients and between different professional groups, and fit well with the organisational goals and skill sets of existing staff. However, where implementers perceived problems in one or more of these areas, they also perceived a lower level of normalization.
   Conclusions: Implementers had rich understandings of barriers and facilitators to successful implementation of e-health initiatives, and their views should continue to be sought in future research. NPT can be used to explain observed variations in implementation processes, and may be useful in drawing planners' attention to potential problems with a view to addressing them during implementation planning.

AB Introduction: The aging of the Canadian population is associated with a rising burden of heart failure (HF), a condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality and health service use.
   Methods: We used data from the Ontario Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care database for all long-stay home care clients aged 65 years or older to (1) describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of home care clients with HF and (2) examine service use among home care clients with HF to promote management at home with appropriate services.
   Results: Compared with other home care clients, HF clients exhibit more health instability, take more medications, experience more comorbid conditions and receive significantly more nursing, homemaking and meal services. They are hospitalized more frequently, have significantly more emergency department visits and use more emergent care.
   Discussion: HF clients are a more complex group than home care clients in general. Patient self-care must be tailored to the clinical characteristics, patterns of service use and barriers to self-care of the client. This is particularly true for older, frail and medically complex HF patients, many of whom require home care services. This work provides a background upon which to base initiatives to help these higher-needs clients manage their HF at home with appropriate support and services.

TI Senior-friendly emergency department care: an environmental assessment
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH & POLICY

DT Article

AB Objectives: To assess the environment of an emergency department (ED) and its impact on care of adults aged 75 and over, using a 'senior-friendly' conceptual framework that included the physical environment, social climate, hospital policies and procedures, and wider health care system.
   Methods: In this focused ethnography, we collected and analysed data from the ED of a regional acute care hospital located in Ontario, Canada from October 2007 to January 2008. Data collection included interviews with seniors or their proxy decision-makers, staff and key community informants; on-site observations; a staff survey; and hospital administrative data. Data sets were individually analysed and a synthesis of findings developed to formulate recommendations for policy, practice and education.
   Results: Staff expressed their vision of providing senior-friendly care. However, the ED was fast-paced, overcrowded, chaotic and lacked orientation and wayfinding cues, as well as appropriate equipment and furniture, all of which created barriers to providing appropriate care. Seniors' expectations often went unmet and staff expressed moral angst at recognizing unmet needs. Some hospital policies and procedures compounded these difficulties, including hallway practice, lack of off-hour access to multidisciplinary health care professionals, and the inability of patients to access food and drink. Better communication and coordination between the ED and other components of the health care system are needed.
   Conclusions: The ED is an important part of seniors' health care. Changes to policy and practices, and enhanced education must occur to better meet the complex health care needs of seniors. This assessment provides a method that can be replicated elsewhere to generate site-specific recommendations and initiate capacity development processes to enhance senior-friendly care.

ID MODEL
AB Introduction: Integrating care is a developing feature of provincial health delivery in Canada for those with chronic conditions. The purposes of this project were to review the conceptual understandings underlying integrated care, examine the features of models of cost-effective care for the elderly, and then ascertain to what extent Canadian provinces were implementing these features.
   Method: These goals were accomplished through a review of the integrated care literature followed by a survey of the Canadian provinces. A pretested questionnaire was sent to each of the 10 provincial Ministries of Health in 2008. The questionnaire collected basic background information and then asked a series of open- and close-ended questions about each of the best practice features of integrated care as found in the literature review.
   Results: System improvements in integrating care for the elderly are being implemented in Canadian provincial health care systems. There has been substantial improvement in the delivery of case management services but the supply of some community services could be improved. As well, the linkages amongst primary, acute and community care remain weak.
   Discussion and conclusion: Providing an adequate supply of services is an ongoing issue in many provinces and could be the result of either inadequate funding and/or poor targeting of scarce resources. While it is promising that so many provinces are starting to break down the silos amongst types of health care service providers, much remains to be accomplished. These issues are at the core of integrating care and are among the challenges being faced by other countries.

ID MOBILITY
AB The aging of the American population has raised a number of concerns about senior mobility. The New Freedom (NF) program, which was designed to go above and beyond the transportation requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, has been used to fund transportation for seniors. The primary purpose of this paper is to present the results of an exploratory analysis of the social, physical, and functional health and mobility outcomes experienced by seniors who are clients of NF services and the associated Coordinated Human Services Transportation Plan (CHSTP) processes. The paper uses data from primary surveys of the following groups from seven urban, suburban, and rural locations: (a) NF-funded transportation service users, (b) program managers operating the services, and (c) locally selected lead and partner organizations involved in developing the CHSTPs. Results show that concerns about senior mobility vary significantly by a number of functional, social, and physical disability indicators, including instrumental activities of daily living. These indicators are substantially more complex than a chronological accounting of age. A principal component analysis yielded two constructs underlying seniors' mobility: a transportation deprivation component and an independence and health deprivation component. Each component has implications for different types of services. To the extent that the NF program has supported transportation services that are supplemental to integrated care for seniors and thereby enable a continuum of care, the program has enhanced community-based interventions to meet the complex mobility needs of seniors in the seven locations.

AB Rationale, aims and objectives
   The incidence of falls and fall-related injuries in older age is predicted to increase concomitantly with global population ageing, representing a serious challenge to health care systems. In spite of the availability of policy and practice guidelines for the prevention of falls and fall-related injuries, a considerable gap remains between best practice and current health service delivery. This paper describes the method and results of the implementation and evaluation of a state-wide workforce enhancement strategy to promote the uptake of evidence-based falls prevention activities for older people.
   Methods
   The project was undertaken in Queensland, Australia in 2008 across the community, acute and residential aged care sectors. Six Falls Safety Officers (FSOs) were appointed to implement a 1-year pilot of strategies aimed at enhancing workforce capacity to deliver a coordinated approach to falls prevention across the care continuum. The project was independently evaluated for process, impact and outcome. Both quantitative and qualitative data were extracted from records maintained by the FSOs for the evaluation and additional data were obtained from interviews with key stakeholders.
   Results
   Considerable progress was achieved towards the project's objectives, including the wide dissemination of information and resources, as well as the establishment of working groups to continue falls prevention planning and implementation. Barriers and facilitators to the project's implementation were identified.
   Conclusion
   The formal evaluation provides evidence for the development of a cross-continuum service delivery model for implementing coordinated state-wide falls prevention strategies for the prevention of falls in older people.

TI Avoidable readmission in Hong Kong - system, clinician, patient or
   social factor?
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ELDERLY PATIENTS; HOSPITAL READMISSIONS; MEDICINE
AB Background: Studies that identify reasons for readmissions are gaining importance in the light of the changing demographics worldwide which has led to greater demand for hospital beds. It is essential to profile the prevalence of avoidable readmissions and understand its drivers so as to develop possible interventions for reducing readmissions that are preventable. The aim of this study is to identify the magnitude of avoidable readmissions, its contributing factors and costs in Hong Kong. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 332,453 inpatient admissions in the Medical specialty in public hospital system in Hong Kong in year 2007. A stratified random sample of patients with unplanned readmission within 30 days after discharge was selected for medical record reviews. Eight physicians reviewed patients' medical records and classified whether a readmission was avoidable according to an assessment checklist. The results were correlated with hospital inpatient data.
   Results: It was found that 40.8% of the 603 unplanned readmissions were judged avoidable by the reviewers. Avoidable readmissions were due to: clinician factor (42.3%) including low threshold for admission and premature discharge etc.; patient factor (including medical and health factor) (41.9%) such as relapse or progress of previous complaint, and compliance problems etc., followed by system factor (14.6%) including inadequate discharge planning, inadequate palliative care/terminal care, etc., and social factor (1.2%) such as carer system, lack of support and community services. After adjusting for patients' age, gender, principal diagnosis at previous discharge and readmission hospitals, the risk factors for avoidable readmissions in the total population i.e. all acute care admissions irrespective of whether there was a readmission or not, included patients with a longer length of stay, and with higher number of hospitalizations and attendance in public outpatient clinics and Accident and Emergency departments in the past 12 months. In the analysis of only unplanned readmissions, it was found that the concordance of the principal diagnosis for admission and readmission, and shorter time period between discharge and readmission were associated with avoidable readmissions.
   Conclusions: Our study found that almost half of the readmissions could have been prevented. They had been mainly due to clinician and patient factors, in particular, both of which were intimately related to clinical management and patient care. These readmissions could be prevented by a system of ongoing clinical review to examine the clinical practice/decision for discharge, and improving clinical care and enhancing patient knowledge of the early warning signs for relapse. The importance of adequate and appropriate ambulatory care to support the patients in the community was also a key finding to reduce avoidable readmissions. Education on patient self-management should also be enhanced to minimize the patient factors with regard to avoidable readmission. Our findings thus provide important insights into the development of an effective discharge planning system which should place patients and carers as the primacy focus of care by engaging them along with the healthcare professionals in the whole discharge planning process.

AB We document the methodological challenges of conducting a health survey of an ethnically diverse elderly community-dwelling Medicaid population by telephone. Individuals (N=5,382) 65 years and older were randomly selected from a state Medicaid Management Information System and 618 eligible participants were interviewed. Participants were classified as non-Hispanic White, English-speaking (NHW-E; 69.2%), non-Hispanic Black, English-speaking (NHB-E; 6.2%), Hispanic, Spanish-speaking (H-S; 9.2%), and Hispanic, English-speaking (H-E; 4.2%). Almost half (44.2%) of the individuals sampled were unreachable, most often because of no valid telephone number. More interviewer time was required to reach and interview Hispanic participants. On average, interviews with H-S and H-E were 11 and 8 minutes longer, respectively, than with NHW-E. Spanish-speaking Hispanic respondents reported very high rates of receipt of preventive services relative to the other groups. These high rates by Spanish-speakers may be due to actual greater utilization or biases in self-reported data due to response style differences.

AB Background Prior studies suggest that disease management programs may be effective in improving clinical and economic outcomes in patients with heart failure Whether these types of programs can lower health care cost and be adapted to the primary care setting is unknown This study was designed to assess the impact of a home-based disease management program, the Alere DayLink HF Monitoring System (HFMS) on the clinical and economic outcomes of Medicare beneficiaries recently hospitalized for heart failure who received the care from a community based primary care practitioner
   Methods and Results The Heart Failure Home Care trial was a multicenter randomized controlled trial of sophisticated monitoring of heart failure patients with an interactive program versus standard heart failure care with enhanced patient education and follow-up (SC) in Medicare-eligible patients The study end points included cardiovascular death or rehospitalization for heart failure length of hospital stay, total patient cost and cost to Medicare at 6 months of enrollment A total of 315 patients age >= 65 years old were randomized 160 to the HFMS and 155 to SC There were no significant statistical differences between the groups in regards to 6-month cardiac mortality rehospitalizations for heart failure or length of hospital stay Of those, 304 patients had their Medicare data available The information from the Medicare claims data was used to determine the cost Information from the trial was used to determine costs of out-patient drugs and the interventions The 6 month mean Medicare costs were estimated to be $17 837 and $13 886 for the HFMS and the SC groups respectively We found that overall medical costs of medicare patients were significantly higher for patients who were randomized to the HFMS arm than they were for the patients randomized to the SC arm
   Conclusions Our study results suggest that enhanced patient education and follow-up is as successful as a sophisticated home monitoring device with an interactive program and less costly in patients who are elderly and receive the care from a community-based primary care practitioner (J Cardiac Fail 2010 16 859-866)

AB Objectives: This study examined the relationship between older adults' expectations to move and actual residential relocation in the community or to a nursing facility within 2 years. Method: Two waves of data (2000, 2002) from the Health and Retirement Study were used to compare expectations with subsequent moves. Logistic regression techniques were used to analyze the association between decision outcomes and expectations to move, health and functioning, physical environment, informal supports, and formal services. Results: Findings indicated that expectations to move did predict community-based moves but did not predict moves to nursing facilities. Additional factors had significant effects but did not diminish relationships between expectations and actual moves. Discussion: Results support the residential decision process as a dynamic one based on the cumulative effect of factors from an ecological model. Findings will inform policy makers and practitioners as they work to support older adults' preferences to remain living in their homes.

AB Background Immunization preventable bacterial pneumonia is an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) prevention quality indicator of health care. This study explored associations of individual and county correlates with bacterial pneumonia hospitalization rates for elders residing in 32 Texas counties bordering Mexico. Methods We estimated baseline rates from Texas Health Care Information Collection's hospital discharge data for 1999-2001, and population counts from the 2000 U. S. Census. Results The rate among the total Texas border population was 500/10,000, three times the national rate. Elders 75+, males, and Latinos had the highest rates. An increase of 1 primary care physician per 1000 population is associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related hospitalization rates by 33%, while each 10% increase in Latinos is associated with a 0.1% rate increase. Discussion This baseline bacterial pneumonia hospitalization study demonstrates a systematic approach to estimate county rates, a process that could lead to improved outcomes through effective community interventions. Methodology demonstrates how publicly available hospital discharge data can be used by communities to better measure and improve quality of health care.

ID INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY USAGE; EASE; TRUST; FIELD; MODEL
AB This case involves a B2B2C model (service provider to community to the elderly) of innovative tele-care services. The service provider under study is Chu-Shan Show-Chwan Hospital, a district hospital in Nantou County, Taiwan. The community comprises social welfare institutions such as temples, community care centers, and nursing homes. Finally, the elderly individuals who are the ultimate targets of the service are either community residents or residents of nursing homes. The community, as a service promoter, contributes to the increased acceptance of the newly introduced tele-care service compared with the traditional B2C model. Numerous communities under study and some social welfare organizations are extremely interested in providing healthcare services to the elderly and will support future operations provided satisfactory results are achieved. This project can help district hospitals extend their primary care function to communities, build trust, and improve relationships between physicians and patients.

AB Purpose: Elder self-neglect (ESN) represents half or more of all cases reported to adult protective services. ESN directly affects older adults and also their families, neighbors, and the larger communities around them. ESN has public health implications and is associated with higher than expected mortality rates, hospitalizations, long-term care placements, and localized environmental and safety hazards. This article describes results from a study using concept mapping to create a conceptual model of ESN. Design and Methods: Two brainstorming sessions were convened with senior services program supervisors, geriatricians, local policy analysts and program planners, elder law practitioners, and university-based researchers (n = 20), and a list of 73 ESN indicators was generated. Using Concept Systems software, the 20 original panelists and an additional 30 practitioners, including case managers and supervisors from local agencies, social workers specializing in working with older adults, and elder abuse investigators, sorted the 73 items and rated them along the dimension of importance for the concept of self-neglect. Results: Using hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling, a conceptual map with 7 clusters was produced. Clusters with the highest importance ratings were Physical Living Conditions and Mental Health. Clusters were highly interrelated, with the exception of the Physical Living Conditions cluster. Implications: This research presents a conceptualization of ESN, identifies the constituent domains, and proposes a conceptual model based on the importance for assessing symptoms and indicators. Findings may help focus programmatic and research efforts, leading to the development of measures that open the field for further research and theory generation.

LA English
DT Article

   MANAGEMENT; TIME
AB Background: Screening and early diagnosis has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with certain conditions such as cervical cancer. The role of general practitioners in promoting primary prevention of diseases is particularly important given that they have frequent contact with a large proportion of the population. This study assessed the extent to which general practitioners documented recommended preventive screening interventions among eligible patients.
   Methods: We used a retrospective chart audit to assess patient visits to primary care clinics in Calgary, Canada from 2002-2004. We included fee for service physicians who practiced >= 2 days per week at their current location and excluded those whose primary practice was at walk-in clinics, community health centers, hospitals or emergency rooms. We included charts of patients who during the study period were age 35 years or older and had at least 2 visits to a clinic. We randomly selected and reviewed charts (N = 600) from 12 primary care clinics and abstracted information on 6 conditions recommended for preventive screening. Opportunities for preventive screening were determined based on recommendations of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, the American College of Physicians, and the Canadian Cancer Society. Our main outcome measures included cancer screening (mammography and pap smears), immunization (influenza and pneumococcal), and risk factor assessment (cholesterol measurement and smoking cessation consultation).
   Results: Patient visits to GP clinics present opportunities for preventive screening. However, we found that documentation of interventions was low, ranging from 40.3% (cholesterol measurement) to 0.9% (pneumococcal vaccination) within 1 year, and from 67.4% to 1.8% within the prior 3 years.
   Conclusions: Documentation of preventive screening interventions by general practitioners was relatively low compared to the number of patients eligible for preventive screening. Some physicians opt to screen for PSA and DRE which is not recommended by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive HealthCare.

ID RISK APPRAISAL; GENERAL-PRACTICE
AB Successive English government policies about older people's health and well-being aim to improve health and quality of life by promoting independence. Improving access to information and services that can improve health and well-being and reduce health risks is central to the modernisation of health and social care. Most recently, tailored and person-centred approaches with a strong emphasis on promoting health and well-being are central to policy, including the proposals for 'Life Checks' and the recent emphasis on commissioning 'community well-being'. We carried out a qualitative study to identify the key aspects of social situations that affect health and well-being, from the perspectives of older people and professionals, to enrich and expand an existing health risk appraisal tool so that it could be used for self-assessment of health and social well-being. This tool, Health Risk Appraisal in Older people (HRAO), has been evaluated in different European settings, including English general practice. Focus groups were recruited from general practice, older people's forums, social care and voluntary organisations in two London boroughs where the HRAO tool had previously been tested. The social factors determining health that were prioritised by older people and service providers and recommended for inclusion in the health risk appraisal tool were recent life events, housing and garden maintenance, transport, both public and private, financial management, carer status & needs, the local environment and social networks and social isolation. This study has identified key social determinants of health that could usefully be added to 'Life Checks' for older people and that could also inform the commissioning of community well-being. Modified with the addition of social domains, the HRAO technology could be a suitable tool to achieve current policy objectives.

AB Purpose: The article seeks to identify patterns of service utilization among informal caregivers of frail older adults. In particular, the study examined determinants that explain heterogeneous variations in caregivers' service use patterns. Methods: Using a latent class analysis (LCA) on the 2004 National Long-Term Care Survey and Informal Caregiver data (n = 1,908), this study classifies overall patterns of caregiver service utilization: financial information, support group, respite service, day care or senior center, personal or nursing care, housework, meal delivery, transportation, house modification, and assistive devices. With an emphasis on caregivers' service use patterns and social network derived from the Network Episode Model, the modified Andersen model guides determinants of these patterns. Results: The LCA classified a hierarchical structure of service use patterns: multiple service users, selective in-home service users, and light service users. Caregivers' network compositions signified heterogeneity in service use patterns. Care recipient- and caregiver-related needs contributed to distinguishing service use patterns. Implications: Differentiation of services may be important for meeting caregivers' needs and distributing program resources by identifying target populations for intervention. This typology process may tailor specific interventions to better support caregivers.

AB Aim: This study explored the effect of internal adaptation and external resources to psychological well-being for the disabled elderly. Methods: Data were collected by face-to-face interviews with physically disabled elderly people, including the institutional and community-based long-term care service users in middle Taiwan. The number of persons interviewed was 563, of whom 505 completed the survey and met the disability criteria. Path analysis was applied. Internal resources (coping strategies and self-management of health) and external resources (social support and environmental support) were hypothesized to be related to difficulty in adapting to disability, and had a further impact on depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Results: Acceptance-action coping strategies were beneficial in the adaptation process and in psychological well-being, and self-management of health was positively related to successful adaptation. Social support and environmental support were beneficial to adaptation and psychological well-being, although the effects were modest. In general, the effect of internal resources was larger than the external resources to adaptation and psychological well-being. Conclusion: Positive coping and self-management as well as the use of external resources are positive indicators of successful adaptation to disability. The disabled elderly should be encouraged to take a positive attitude toward disability, and external resources should also be built up to support them.

AB Objectives: Elderly persons with a physiologic hearing deficit (hearing impairment) are not necessarily socially or emotionally disturbed by the deficit in everyday life (hearing handicap). The self-perception of a hearing handicap in elderly people is a key element in seeking consultation for a hearing impairment or using hearing aids. Thus, it is important to determine the factors associated with the self-perception of a hearing handicap. The aims of the present study were to report the relation between a hearing impairment and the self-perception of a hearing handicap, and the factors associated with a self-perceived hearing handicap among a group of randomly recruited, community-dwelling elderly persons, aged 65 yr and older, in Taipei, Taiwan.
   Design: A cross-sectional survey of community-dwelling elderly persons aged 65 yr and older (N = 1220) participating in an annual general purpose geriatric health examination in 2005 in Taipei. Pure-tone audiometry and a questionnaire including the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly-Screening Version (HHIE-S) were administered, after obtaining the subject's consent to participate in the study. Demographic information, lifestyle, self-report. health status, and biochemical data were also collected.
   Results: There was a moderate association (gamma(s) = 0.52) between hearing impairment and self-perceived handicap. Only 21.4% of the study subjects with moderate to profound hearing impairment (M4 >= 41 dB HL, N = 555) perceived themselves as hearing-handicapped (HHIE-S total score :10). Besides hearing level, marital status (widowed) and self-perceived general health (bad or neutral) were factors that are significantly associated with a self-perceived hearing handicap among elderly subjects with moderate to profound hearing impairment. For study subjects with moderate to profound hearing impairment (M4 >= 41 dB HL), 5.0% of those with HHIE-S <10 and 45.4% of those with HHIE-S >= 10 used or felt that they required hearing aids (chi(2) test, p < 0.001). These data suggested that a self-perceived hearing handicap (HHIE-S >= 10) is an important indicator for referral of elderly persons for hearing-aid fitting.
   Conclusions: Our study findings, consistent with those of previous studies, demonstrated that not all elderly persons with impaired hearing function (hearing impairment) perceived a hearing deficit socially or emotionally in everyday life (hearing handicap). Marital status (widowed) and bad/neutral general health were nonaudiologically associated factors with a hearing handicap in the present study. Further, those with a self-perceived hearing handicap reported a higher rate of the use of, or requirement for, hearing aids. Because hearing deterioration is a common biologic process of aging, the results of this study can be used to identify the groups among elderly people with a greater need for hearing screening and hearing rehabilitation services.

AB About one in five older Australians were born overseas. However, there has been very little information published in Australia or internationally about dementia in persons from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. This limits our ability to plan for and provide evidence-based medical care, social care and aged care services to persons from CALD backgrounds. This paper describes challenges to conducting CALD dementia research; these include sampling, having valid instruments and costs. Nine key research recommendations in the areas of epidemiology, community knowledge, carers, service delivery, screening and assessment, medical management, residential aged care and minority CALD reached by consensus by an expert group are presented. The paper closes with some strategies to encourage CALD research. The material presented here will provide guidance for future research endeavours.

TI Behind Closed Doors: What Happens when Patients and Providers Talk about
   Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening? Survey of the Effects of a
   Community-Based Intervention
SO PATIENT-PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH

AB Background: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is controversial because of uncertainty about whether it reduces mortality and whether the potential benefits outweigh the harms. Given these uncertainties, many medical associations recommend using an informed decision-making (IDM) process for making decisions about PSA screening, so that men can make well informed decisions that reflect their values and preferences.
   Objective: The aim of this paper was to describe the communication exchange between men and their providers regarding PSA screening and the outcomes associated with having a discussion about screening from the patient perspective.
   Methods: We evaluated survey results obtained at baseline and approximately 12 months post-intervention. Baseline data collection took place in community-based organizations, and follow-up data were collected by mail. Men between 40 and 80 years of age who had not been diagnosed with prostate cancer were eligible for the study. We implemented a multicomponent, community-based intervention designed to help men make informed decisions about PSA screening. Primary outcome measures included characteristics of patient-provider discussions, screening behavior, feeling informed and satisfied, and patients' preferred and actual levels of involvement in screening decisions and concordance between the two.
   Results: Overall, 59% of men (220 of 373) had a discussion with a healthcare professional about the PSA screening test. Older men (those aged >= 50 years), Black men, and those who were married were more likely to talk to a provider. When a discussion did occur, two out of three men said that the discussion affected their decision making, and one-quarter changed their screening choice as a result. According to patients, there was apparent variation regarding the extent to which providers recommended the PSA test: 68% of providers recommended it and 3% did not recommend it. One in ten men said that the provider ordered the test without making a recommendation, while 15% of men said that providers did not make a recommendation and wanted the patient to decide.
   We found that the discussion between the patient and the provider about PSA screening was significantly associated with a greater probability of feeling informed and higher levels of satisfaction with the decision that was made. Most men preferred to be and were involved in the PSA screening decision collaboratively with their providers. When preferred and actual levels of involvement were concordant (i.e. men participated at their preferred level) and when men asked questions, men reported feeling more informed and satisfied about the screening decision.
   Conclusion: Ongoing education about the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation with respect to PSA screening should occur not only at the patient level but also at the provider level. More widespread adoption of the IDM process, which inherently involves building a patient's self-efficacy and skills needed to engage in it, is likely to take time.

AB Background: There is a growing need for information on evidence-based practices that may potentially address needs of elderly people with severe mental illness (SMI), and more specifically on community-based services such as assertive community treatment (ACT). Methods: This study examines national evaluation data from fiscal year 2001-2005 from Veterans Affairs Mental Health Intensive Case Management (MHICM) program (N = 5,222), an ACT-based service model, to characterize the age distribution of participants and the distinctive needs, patterns of service delivery, and treatment outcomes for elderly veterans. Results: Altogether, 24.8% of participants were 55-64 years; 7.4% 65-74 years; and 2.8% were older than 75. Veterans over 75 formed a distinct subgroup that had a later age of onset of primarily nonpsychotic illnesses without comorbid substance abuse and had experienced more limited lifetime hospital treatment than younger participants. Older veterans were less symptomatic and more satisfied with their social relationships than younger clients. They mostly live independently or in minimally restrictive housing, but they received less recovery-focused services and more crisis intervention and medical services. They thus do not appear to be young patients with SMI who have aged but rather constitute a distinct group with serious late-onset problems. It is possible that MHICM services keep them in the community and avoid costly nursing home placement while providing a respite service that reduces family burden. Conclusion: These data highlight the unique characteristics of older veterans receiving ACT-like services and the need to focus greater attention on recovery-oriented services as well as community support for this subgroup.

AB To estimate the effect of an evidence-based depression care management (DCM) intervention on the initiation and appropriate use of antidepressant in primary care patients with late-life depression.
   Secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial.
   Community, primary care.
   Randomly selected individuals aged 60 and older with routine appointments at 20 primary care clinics randomized to provide a systematic DCM intervention or care as usual.
   Rates of antidepressant use and dose adequacy of patients in the two study arms were compared at each patient assessment (baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months). For patients without any antidepressant treatment at baseline, a longitudinal analysis was conducted using multilevel logistic models to compare the rate of antidepressant treatment initiation, dose adequacy when initiation was first recorded, and continued therapy for at least 4 months after initiation between study arms. All analyses were conducted for the entire sample and then repeated for the subsample with major or clinically significant minor depression at baseline.
   Rates of antidepressant use and dose adequacy increased over the first year in patients assigned to the DCM intervention, whereas the same rates held constant in usual care patients. In longitudinal analyses, the DCM intervention had a significant effect on initiation of antidepressant treatment (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=5.63, P <.001) and continuation of antidepressant medication for at least 4 months (OR=6.57, P=.04) for patients who were depressed at baseline.
   Evidence-based DCM models are highly effective at improving antidepressant treatment in older primary care patients.

AB Objectives: This study sought to examine the combination of formal and informal services supplied to older adults with severe mental illness, to assess the adequacy of services received, and to determine factors predictive of formal and informal service provision. Methods: A cross-sectional research design was employed. Seventy-five older adults diagnosed with a SMI were recruited through local community mental health center. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews using the Camberwell Assessment of Needs for the Elderly. Results: Clients most frequently received services from formal sources for psychiatric distress, physical health, information, and dangerous behavior needs while informal sources provided the greatest amount of assistance for self-care, psychiatric distress, and money management needs. Appropriate assistance was most often not provided for benefits, sight/hearing, and incontinence. Formal services were predicted by group residence and dangerous behavior, physical illness, medication, and daily activity needs. Assistance from informal sources was predicted by private residence, self-care, mobility, and money management needs. Discussion: While formal and informal sources provided adequate services for certain client needs, over 70% of the clients did not receive the correct type of help for some of their needs. Greater communication between mental health care staff and informal caregivers, and the integration of aging network services, is essential for the adequate provision of care to older severely mentally ill (SMI) adults. Education and greater linkages among care providers are necessary so that all service providers are aware of and are able to appropriately respond to the complex multi-level needs experienced by older SMI adults.

AB Advances in health care for people with intellectual disabilities (ID) that have resulted in increased longevity also force health care providers, researchers, and policymakers to question the adequacy of chronic disease management for the growing number of middle aged and elderly persons in this population. We report on sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus in an ethnically/racially diverse sample of people with ID in New York City. Administrative and chart review data were collected from a community-based specialty medical practice for people with intellectual disabilities. Adult subjects were included if they had an intellectual disability, lived in the community either independently or with relatives, received all of their planned, outpatient health care services though this practice, and had a primary care visit within the study period. One hundred twenty-six (43.0%) persons were obese, 58 (19.9%) had hypertension, 77 (26.5%) had hypercholesterolemia, and 13 (4.5%) had diabetes mellitus. Age, gender, and BMI (for the latter three conditions) were the most consistent risk factors. Intellectual functioning and behavioral problems were not associated with greater odds of these conditions. This study provides crucial information for improving community-based primary care for people with intellectual disabilities. Specifically, these findings highlight the importance of constructing innovative strategies to mitigate chronic disease risk factors in this population that involve community-based case management service providers who can help adults with ID and their families adopt needed lifestyle and behavior changes.

DE aging with disability; assistive technology; functional decline
AB This study used a randomized control group design to investigate the impact of an assistive technology and home modification intervention on function for individuals who are aging with a disability. There were 91 participants with polio, rheumatoid arthritis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke, and other impairments. Outcome data were collected at 12 and 24 months through in-home interviews using the Older Americans Resources and Services Instrument (OARS) and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and through monthly telephone contact on the hours of in-home care, hospitalizations, and acquisition of AT. The treatment group received an in-home evaluation of their equipment and home modification needs. All recommended AT and home modifications were provided and paid for in full or in part by the study. The control group received the standard community-available health care. A significant "group by time" interaction for the FIM suggested a slower decline in function for the treatment group over 2 years. Further analyses found that the treatment group was more likely to use equipment to maintain independence vs. personal assistance. This study supports the value of assistive technology for adults aging with a disability and suggests that it be provided earlier in the aging process.

AB The aims of this study were to describe: (1) how the Homelessness Intervention Programme addressed the needs of elderly people who were homeless or at risk of homelessness; and (2) the factors that influenced the ability of the programme to address client needs. The programme was offered by a multi-service non-profit agency serving low-income families and individuals in an urban neighbourhood in Ontario, Canada. Using a case study approach, we conducted 10 individual interviews and three focus groups with programme clients, programme providers, other service providers and programme funders. Programme providers completed intake forms, monthly follow-up forms and exit/housing change forms for each of the 129 clients served by the programme over a 28-month period. Approximately equal proportions of clients were between 54 years old and 65 years old (47%) and over 65 years (53%). There were equal proportions of women and men. In addition to being homeless or marginally housed, clients lived with multiple and complex issues including chronic illness, mental illness and substance abuse. Through the facilitation of continuity of care, the programme was able to meet the needs of this vulnerable group of elderly people. Three types of continuity of care were facilitated: relational, informational and management continuity. The study confirmed the value of a continuous caring relationship with an identified provider and the delivery of a seamless service through coordination, integration and information sharing between different providers. Study findings also highlighted the broader systemic factors that acted as barriers to the programme and its ability to meet the needs of elderly people. These factors included limited housing options available; limited income supports; and lack of coordinated, accessible community health and support services. The central findings stress the importance of continuity of care as a guiding concept for intervention programmes for homeless and marginally housed elderly people.

AB Telehealth applications and information communication technologies can be customized and scaled to meet the healthcare service needs of a wide variety of special populations. Categorization of those special groups can be viewed from a spectrum of perspectives such as by gender, age, culture, families, communities, chronic conditions, or particular types of locations, as well as when addressing a specific or unique health need. The emergence of innovations in the use of a range of technologies and connectivity offers exciting new approaches to the integration of telehealth aimed at improving quality and continuity of care to better meet the needs of special populations.

AB Background: There is considerable variation in service use, with overuse in conditions such as upper respiratory tract infections and high levels of unmet need in older patients with embarrassing conditions such as incontinence. The reasons for this situation are varied but to facilitate appropriate accessing of services the decision processes involved in help-seeking require greater understanding.
   Objectives: This study aimed to describe the decision making process for help-seeking in middle and older aged people with urinary storage symptoms.
   Methods: In-depth qualitative interviews were carried out with 33 men and women who had sought medical care for urinary symptoms. Respondents were recruited from an epidemiological study of the prevalence of urinary symptoms in community dwelling adults aged 40 years and over. Questions were directed at help-seeking for urinary symptoms as well as help-seeking in general. Interviews were audio-taped and a thematic analysis carried out according to grounded theory methods.
   Results: The steps in the decision process to seek medical care were drawn from the data. These consisted of appraisals of the presence and cause of symptoms, treatment options and the severity of symptoms and their impact on quality of life. Once the level of threat of the symptom was established, the costs and benefits of treatments and services were balanced against the perceived impact of symptoms on quality of life. These results were considered in relation to available models of health behaviour.
   Conclusions: Interventions that increase individuals' active involvement in their health care and which encourage greater knowledge of symptoms and outcomes will facilitate appropriate help-seeking and service use. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Process factors explaining the ineffectiveness of a multidisciplinary
   fall prevention programme: A process evaluation
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English

   FALLS; RECURRENT FALLS; ACCIDENT
AB Background: Falls are a major health threat to older community-living people, and initiatives to prevent falls should be a public health priority. We evaluated a Dutch version of a successful British fall prevention programme. Results of this Dutch study showed no effects on falls or daily functioning. In parallel to the effect evaluation, we carried out a detailed process evaluation to assess the feasibility of our multidisciplinary fall prevention programme. The present study reports on the results of this process evaluation.
   Methods: Our fall prevention programme comprised a medical and occupational-therapy assessment, resulting in recommendations and/or referrals to other services if indicated. We used self-administered questionnaires, structured telephone interviews, structured recording forms, structured face-to-face interviews and a plenary group discussion to collect data from participants allocated to the intervention group (n = 166) and from all practitioners who performed the assessments (n = 8). The following outcomes were assessed: the extent to which the multidisciplinary fall prevention programme was performed according to protocol, the nature of the recommendations and referrals provided to the participants, participants' self-reported compliance and participants' and practitioners' opinions about the programme.
   Results: Both participants and practitioners judged the programme to be feasible. The programme was largely performed according to protocol. The number of referrals and recommendations ensuing from the medical assessment was relatively small. Participants' self-reported compliance as regards contacting their GP to be informed of the recommendations and/or referrals was low to moderate. However, self-reported compliance with such referrals and recommendations was reasonable to good. A large majority of participants reported they had benefited from the programme.
   Conclusion: The results of the present study show that the programme was feasible for both practitioners and participants. Main factors that seem to be responsible for the lack of effectiveness are the relatively low number of referrals and recommendations ensuing from the medical assessments and participants' low compliance as regards contacting their GP about the results of the medical assessment. We do not recommend implementing the programme in its present form in regular care.

TI Unfilled prescriptions of medicare beneficiaries: Prevalence, reasons,
   and types of medicines prescribed
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE PHARMACY
LA English
DT Article
ID CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS; NATIONAL-SURVEY; UNITED-STATES; COST;
   NONADHERENCE; PATIENT; ADHERENCE; HEALTH; MEDICATIONS; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: Despite the proven efficacy of prescription regimens in reducing disease symptoms and preventing or minimizing complications, poor medication adherence remains a significant public health problem. Medicare beneficiaries have high rates of chronic illness and prescription medication use, making this population particularly vulnerable to non-adherence. Failure to fill prescribed medication is a key component of nonadherence.
   OBJECTIVES: To (1) determine the rates of self-reported failure to fill at least 1 prescription among a sample of Medicare beneficiaries in 2004, (2) identify the reasons for not filling prescribed medication, (3) examine the characteristics of Medicare beneficiaries who failed to fill their prescription (s), and (4) identify the types of medications that were not obtained.
   METHODS: The study is a secondary analysis of the 2004 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), an ongoing national panel survey conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Medicare beneficiaries living in the community (N =14,464) were asked: "During the current year [2004], were there any medicines prescribed for you that you did not get (please include refills of earlier prescriptions as well as prescriptions that were written or phoned in by a doctor)?" Those who responded "yes" to this question (n=664) were asked to identify the specific medication(s) not obtained. Rates of failure to fill were compared by demographic and income categories and for respondents with versus without self-reported chronic conditions, identified by asking respondents if they had ever been told by a doctor that they had the condition. Weighted population estimates for nonadherence were calculated using Professional Software for SUrvey DAta ANalysis for Multi-stage Sample Designs (SUDAAN) to account for the MCBS multistage stratified cluster sampling process. Unweighted counts of the prescriptions not filled by therapeutic class were calculated using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS).
   RESULTS: In 2004, an estimated 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries (4.4%) failed to fill or refill 1 or more prescriptions. The most common reasons cited for failure to fill were: "thought it would cost too much" (55.5%), followed by "medicine not covered by insurance" (20.2%), "didn't think medicine was necessary for the condition" (18.0%), and "was afraid of medicine reactions/contraindications" (11.8%). Rates of failure to fill were significantly higher among Medicare beneficiaries aged 18 to 64 years eligible through Social Security Disability Insurance (10.4%) than among beneficiaries aged 65 years or older (3.3%, P< 0.001). Rates were slightly higher for women than for men (5.0 vs. 3.6%, P= 0.001), for nonwhite than for white respondents (5.5% vs. 4.2%, P=0.010), and for dually eligible Medicaid beneficiaries than for those who did not have Medicaid coverage (6.3% vs. 4.0% P=0.001). Failure-to-fill rates were significantly higher among beneficiaries with psychiatric conditions (8.0%, P<0.001); arthritis (5.2%, P<0.001); cardiovascular disease (5.2%, P=0.003); and emphysema, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6.6%, P<0.001) than among respondents who did not report those conditions, and the rate for respondents who reported no chronic conditions was 2.5%. Rates were higher for those with more self-reported chronic conditions (3.2%, 4.0%, 4.3%, and 5.9% for those with 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more conditions, respectively, P< 0.001). Among the prescriptions not filled (993 prescriptions indentified by 664 respondents), central nervous system agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, were most frequently identified (23.6%, n = 234), followed by cardiovascular agents (18.3%, n =182) and endocrine/metabolic agents (6.5%, n = 65). Of the reported unfilled prescriptions, 8.1% were for antihyperlipidemic agents, 5.4% were for antidepressant drugs, 4.6% were for antibiotics, and 29.9% were for unidentified therapy classes.
   CONCLUSION: Most Medicare beneficiaries fill their prescriptions, but some subpopulations are at significantly higher risk for nonadherence associated with unfilled prescriptions, including working-age beneficiaries, dual-eligible beneficiaries, and beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. Self-reported unfilled prescriptions included critical medications for treatment of acute and chronic disease, including antihyperlipidemic agents, antidepressants, and antibiotics.

ID PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM; LIFE; PREFERENCES; OUTCOMES
AB The Palliative Care Service at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC) established a pilot project in the emergency department (ED) to identify chronically ill older adults in need of palliative care, homecare, and hospice services and to link such patients with these services. Two advance practice nurses conducted consultations on elderly patients who were found to have one or more "palliative care triggers" on initial screening. A standardized medical record abstraction form was developed. Service utilization and survival were evaluated using the Clinical Information Systems of MMC. Activity of daily living items were developed from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set and the Palliative Care Performance Scale (PPS). Risk factors for hospitalization and use of the ED were taken from the SIGNET model risk screening tool. Physical and emotional symptoms were evaluated using the 28-item Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale short form. Preliminary outcomes and characteristics are Presented for 291 patients who completed the intake needs assessment questionnaire. Almost one third (30.9%) of the study cohort died during the project period. Most of the deaths occurred beyond the medical center (7.7% died in the medical center and 23.3% outside the medical center). Thirty percent of patients who died were enrolled on a hospice. Survival time was predicted by the presence of dyspnea, clinician prediction of death on the current hospitalization, psychosocial distress, and PPS scores. Chronically ill patients visiting an urban community ED bad complex medical and psychosocial problems with limited support systems and homecare services. Significant proportions of such patients can be expected to have limited likelihood of survival. The presence of palliative homecare and hospice outreach services in the ED in urban community hospitals may provide an effective strategy for linkage of elderly patients at the end of life with otherwise underutilized services.

AB Background: Nurses have played a pivotal role in the delivery of continence services yet little is known about the nature or impact of urinary symptoms experienced by patients in receipt of such care.
   Aim: To define the nature and impact of urinary symptoms experienced by patients in receipt of community nursing services.
   Method: The Leicestershire Urinary Symptoms Questionnaire was administered to 1078 patients with incontinence identified from 176 community nurses' caseloads in 157 general practices in England. Information included type and severity of urinary symptoms, impact on quality of life, help with coping, use of continence products and health service resources.
   Results: Nine hundred and ninety nine (92.7%) patients (median age 79.0 years) returned completed questionnaires. Most patients had incontinence between I and 5 years duration, women were more likely than men to have had long standing (> 5 years) symptoms and more than half the sample reported severe leakage. Women were more likely than men to report symptoms of stress incontinence (71.7% and 46.8%, respectively, p < 0.001) and urge incontinence UI (86.3% vs. 74.8%, respectively, p<0.01). Half of the men and most women also experienced leakage as a result of difficulty getting to, on or off, a toilet/commode. Men were more likely than women to report getting up three or more times a night to pass urine (53.6% vs. 37.0%, respectively, p<0.05).
   Most patients reported that their symptoms had a significant impact on many aspects of quality of life, and 45.7% would be very dissatisfied to continue "the way they are now". Professional help appeared principally one of containment.
   Conclusion: Many people with incontinence receiving community nursing services experience two or more urinary symptoms which, in the majority, have a significant impact on quality of life. Many older patients were not satisfied to "put up" with their urinary symptoms. Current service provision appears to be failing those who are most in need of such care. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study qualitatively assessed the need for mental health services among Latino older adults in San Diego, California. The primary mental health issue was depression. Primary organizational barriers to accessing services were language and cultural barriers secondary to a lack of translators, dearth of information on available services, and scarcity of providers representative of the Latino community. Other challenges included a lack of transportation and housing, and the need for socialization and social support. Latino older adults experienced their unmet needs in ways associated with their cultural background and minority status. Age- and culturally-appropriate services are needed to overcome these barriers.

TI National audit of continence care for older people: management of

ID PREVALENCE; COMMUNITY
AB Introduction: the Department of Health report Good practice in continence services highlights the need for proper assessment and management of urinary incontinence. The National Service Framework for Older People required service providers to establish integrated continence services by April 2004. A national audit was conducted to assess the quality of continence care for older people and whether these requirements have been met.
   Method: the audit studied incontinent individuals of 65years and over. Each site returned data on organisational structure and the process of 20 patients care. Data were submitted via the internet, and all were anonymous.
   Results: the national audit was conducted across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Data on the care of patients/residents with bladder problems were returned by 141/326 (43%) of primary care trusts (PCT), by 159/196 (81%) of secondary care trusts (involving 198 hospitals) and by 29/309 (9%) of invited care homes. In all 58% of PCT, 48% of hospitals and 74% of care homes reported that integrated continence services existed in their area. Whilst basic provision of care appeared to be in place, the audit identified deficiencies in the organisation of services, and in the assessment and management of urinary incontinence in the elderly.
   Conclusion: the results of this audit indicate that the requirement for integrated continence services has not yet been met. Assessment and care by professionals directly looking after the older person were often lacking. There is an urgent need to re-establish the fundamentals of continence care into the practice of medical and nursing staff and action needs to be taken with regard to the establishment of truly integrated, quality services in this neglected area of practice.

AB This study investigates the preferences of senior community nurses who work as district nurse team leaders in selecting preventive care plans for elderly people at high risk of pressure ulcer formation. The discrete choice experiment (DCE) technique was used. Focus group work produced the following five attributes of nurse decision-making: 'ease of care plan management', 'impact of care plan on patient's lifestyle, 'speed of obtaining the equipment', 'affordability', 'evidence-based practice'. These were incorporated into a self-administered questionnaire, posted to 102 nurses from two integrated acute/community NHS Trusts in Wales. A response rate of 55% was achieved. Respondents were asked to rate the importance of the selected attributes on a 5-point scale. They rated 'evidence-based practice', 'impact of care plan on patient's lifestyle', 'ease of care plan management' and 'speed of obtaining the equipment' highly, whereas 'affordability' was of less importance. However, regression analysis, which is part of the DCE technique, produced a somewhat different picture, with 'impact' being least and 'affordability' most statistically significant. The reasons for this apparent anomaly are discussed and the paper concludes that the DCE approach is capable of yielding important information, which is not produced by simple rating exercises. Such information is potentially of value in the context of modernisation and service configuration.

TI A network-based rehabilitation model for frail elderly people::
   development and assessment of a new model

ID CARE; HEALTH; DISABILITY; COMMUNITY
AB Introduction and purpose: Living independently at home promotes the well-being of people aged 65 and over. In Finland, the municipalities are responsible for providing social and health services, including rehabilitation of the elderly. Rehabilitation is in practice carried out by independent rehabilitation centres. The Social Insurance Institution of Finland is a national agency responsible for financing and developing rehabilitation. Combining the efforts of these three agencies, a new network-based inpatient rehabilitation model was established to support the community living of frail elderly persons at high risk of institutionalization. This article describes the new model and evaluates the cooperation within the rehabilitation network, as well as the contents of the rehabilitation.
   Material and methods: The new model was evaluated in two phases using diverse methods. First, the networks were assessed as they were being established in 2000, and secondly, when they were operational in 2002. The first phase involved 53 networks operating in 46 municipalities and 12 rehabilitation centres, and the second 44 networks in 41 municipalities and seven rehabilitation centres. The data were collected by questionnaires, interviews and reports.
   Results: The rehabilitation networks were functional, although constant development and search for better working practices was time consuming. Two different approaches in the networks were found: the 'networks of creators' were able to carry out the new tasks highly successfully, while the 'networks of followers' only managed to do the minimum as instructed. Motivated network members and adequate resources appeared to be essential for a successful rehabilitation process.
   Conclusions: It is possible to create a functional rehabilitation network involving different agencies. Further development work is necessary to make the network-based rehabilitation model more efficient.

AB Effective psychological and pharmacological treatments are available, but for depressed older adults with long-term physical conditions, the outcome of routine care Is generally poor. This paper introduces the chronic care model, a systemic approach to quality improvement and service redesign, which was developed by Ed Wagner and colleagues. The model highlights six key areas that need to be addressed, if depression is to be tackled more effectively in this neglected patient group: delivery system design, patient-provider relationships, decision support, clinical information systems, community resources and healthcare organization. Three influential programmes, the Improving Mood Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment programme, the Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly Collaborative Trial, and the Program to Encourage Active, and Rewarding Lives for Seniors, have shown that when the model is adopted, significant improvements in outcomes can be achieved. The paper concludes with a case study, which illustrates the difference that adopting the chronic care model can make. Radical changes in working practices may be required, to implement the model in practice. However, Greg Simon, a leading researcher in the field of depression care, has suggested that there is already sufficient evidence to justify a shift in emphasis from research towards dissemination and implementation.

AB Objectives. Health care systems throughout the world are in the process of restructuring and reforming their health service delivery systems, reorienting themselves to a primary health care ( PHC) model that uses multidisciplinary practice ( MDP) teams to provide a range of coordinated, integrated services. This study explores the challenges of putting the MDP approach into practice in one community in a city in Canada.
   Methods. The data we analyzed were derived from a community- based participatory action research ( CBPAR) project, conducted in 2004, that was used to enhance collaborative MDP in a PHC center serving a residential and small- business community of 11 000 within a medium- sized city of approximately 300 000 people in Canada. CBPAR is a planned, systematic approach to issues relevant to the community of interest, requires community involvement, has a problem- solving focus, is directed at societal change, and makes a lasting contribution to the community. We drew from one aspect of this complex, multiyear project aimed at transforming the rhetoric advocating PHC reform into actual sustainable practices. The community studied was diverse with respect to age, socioeconomics, and lifestyle. Its interdisciplinary team serves approximately 3 000 patients annually, 30% of whom are 65 years or older. This PHC center's multidisciplinary, integrated approach to care makes it a member of a very distinct minority within the larger primary care system in Canada.
   Results. Analysis of practice in PHC revealed entrenched and unconscious ideas of the limitations and boundaries of practice. In the rhetoric of PHC, MDP was lauded by many. In practice, however, collaborative, multidisciplinary team approaches to care were difficult to achieve.
   Conclusions. The successful implementation of an MDP approach to PHC requires moving away from physician- driven care. This can only be achieved once there is a change in the underlying structures, values, power relations, and roles defined by the health care system and the community at large, where physicians are traditionally ranked above other care providers. The CBPAR methodology allows community members and the health- related professionals who serve them to take ownership of the research and to critically reflect on iterative cycles of evaluation. This provides an opportunity for practitioners to implement relevant changes based on internally generated analyses.

AB The majority of older Australians, some of whom live in retirement villages, wish to remain living in their own home, receiving care in the community when their health and/or other circumstances change. Current statistics show that 3.7% of people aged 65 years and over live in a retirement village in Australia. However, residential aged care will still be required for some highly dependent members of the older population. This qualitative Australian study examined the transition into residential care from one form of community housing, the retirement village. In-depth interviews with 33 older people and 48 family members were conducted to illuminate the key issues and factors which influence the move of older people from retirement villages to residential aged care. Analysis of the data revealed the move to be influenced by: health-related crises; the creation of doubt as to ability to cope in the retirement village; the need for more or different care or support services; the desire for independence; assumptions about being able to move into the residential aged care facility co-located with the retirement village; availability of a place; navigating the system; and desirable aspects of a residential aged care facility. The findings of the study provide a description of the transition process from the perspectives of those directly affected, and contribute to the development of best practice in the provision of support to residents living in retirement villages and the community in general.

TI Participants' perceptions of a lifestyle approach to promoting physical
   activity: targeting deprived communities in Kingston-Upon-Hull
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID EXERCISE
AB Background: The health benefits of an active lifestyle have been extensively documented and generally accepted. In the UK, declining physical activity levels are a major contributing factor to a number of public health concerns such as obesity and coronary heart disease. Clearly, there is an urgent need to support people in developing sustainable active lifestyles. In 2003, a new lifestyle-based physical activity service called Active Lifestyles ( AL) was set up in Kingston-upon-Hull to help local residents to become more active and develop healthier lifestyles. The service targeted the most deprived communities in the city. The aim of the study was to explore participants' perceptions of the operation and effectiveness of the AL service.
   Methods: Five focus groups were conducted in community centres and offices in the health promotion service in Kingston-upon-Hull. Sixteen white adult males (n = 5) and females ( n = 11) participated in the study. Ages ranged from 15 - 73 years ( mean age = 53 years). Data were analysed using a content analysis technique based on the 'framework' approach.
   Results: Three broad themes emerged from the focus groups; the referral process; operational aspects of the AL service; and perceived benefits of the service. Overall, participants were extremely positive about the AL service. Many reported increased activity levels, modified eating habits, and enhanced awareness and education regarding healthier living. Most participants reported that local awareness of the AL service was low and greater promotion was required so more people could benefit. The success of the service was highly dependent upon the qualities and approach of the AL advisor.
   Conclusion: The service appears to have filled a gap in service provision since it offered support to the most sedentary, older, unfit and overweight individuals, many of whom live in the most deprived parts of Kingston-upon-Hull. Traditional exercise referral schemes that focus solely on facility-based exercise should be broadened to encompass everyday lifestyle activity, where referral to a gym or exercise facility is just one of a number of physical activity options.

AB Elderly persons living in the community are a heterogeneous population. Among them, the screening of persons at risk of falling is still a matter of debate. The aim of this analysis was to improve the identification process of elderly persons living in the community at risk for falling by nursing staff of community-based services. A secondary analysis was performed with the data from a prospective non-randomized interventional trial. The study included 268 community-dwelling older adults (mean age of 82 years, 81.3% female) from Ulm and Neu-Ulm with a follow-up period of 12 months. Fall risk indicators were extracted from the nursing assessment and analysis with crude odds ratios revealed the following risk indicators for falls: assistance when transferring, bathing and climbing a flight of stairs as well as fall history. Afterwards, fall risk indicators were selected by backward elimination in a multiple logistic regression. Variable selection identified a positive fall history and the need for assistance when bathing as important risk indicators. These two risk indicators could be used as a screening tool, which would be easy to perform by nursing staff in their daily work. This screening test defined as more than one fall in the last 12 months or bathing assistance, the first ADL to be affected in the disablement process, has a sensitivity of 85.3% and a specificity of 42.1%.

AB How effective is the delivery of health and social services to the older adult? A community-wide needs assessment was conducted in northeast Florida to determine gaps and duplication in health and social services delivery networks for older adults, and to identify major areas of need.
   This article describes the process of working with a community-based organization to develop and conduct an assessment using a mixed methods approach. The resulting study shows that community needs assessments based on both survey data and feedback solicited from individual interviews and a modified focus group approach provides a comprehensive perspective which is needed to effectively evaluate community needs.
   The study results presented a picture of a community with health and social services resources that were not consistently networked and a senior community whose primary need was information on how to locate and access needed services. The results were included in a successful application for a community planning grant and provided ongoing direction for implementation of interventions to address identified needs.

ID RAPID APPRAISAL; ORAL-HEALTH; SERVICES; PEOPLE; NEEDS
AB There are few studies of access to dental care in ethnic minority groups which have compared their findings with those reported by the general adult Population. Furthermore, Studies have focused on either the younger or older members of these communities.
   Aim: this study aimed to identify, barriers to tire uptake of primary dental care in East London, to identify any variation in responses from the general adult population and to report ideas to improve access to primary dental care expressed by the participants.
   Methods: a qualitative Study using community based participatory methods was adopted. Data were generated through purposefully sampled focus groups and analysed using, a grounded approach.
   Setting: East London (UK), 2001.
   Participants: 68 volunteers aged 18-40 years, from the Bangladeshi, Indian, Black Caribbean communities and general adult Population.
   Results: three inter-related themes were found to influence views on access: the structure of primary dental care, cost and anxiety. There was little evidence of differences in barriers to access based on ethnicity alone, reflecting the role of factors such as social class. Adult volunteers with Young families enabled a wider perspective on barriers to access to be achieved, particularly with respect to the impact of the cost of dental care on family budgets. Proposals for reducing the barriers to accessing primary dental care were identified. These addressed a perceived need to extend services through outreach activity, develop communication skills within primary dental care practice and liaise with other primary health care services.
   Conclusion: this focus group Study has confirmed the existence within East London's ethnic minority groups of barriers to accessing primary dental care reported within the general population for some time. That these responses are alike may be accounted for by the common levels of social disadvantage experienced. The rapid appraisal process enabled the identification of proposals to reduce access barriers. These are being implemented and their effectiveness in reducing barriers to accessing primary dental care remains to be established.

AB Objective: To assess the association between pain and depression in a population of older adults.
   Method. We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Aged in Home Care (AdHOC) database, which contains information on older adults receiving home care services in I I European countries from 2001 to 2003. Pain was defined as any type of pain or discomfort manifested over the 7 days preceding the assessment. Depression was defined as a score ! 3 on the Minimum Data Set Depression Rating Scale.
   Results: Mean age of 3976 subjects entering the study was 82.3 years, and 2948 (74.1%) were women. Of the total sample, 2380 subjects presented with pain (59.9%), but its prevalence differed substantially among countries. Depression was diagnosed in 181 (11.3%) of the 1596 participants without pain and in 464 (19.5%) of the 2380 participants with pain (p < .001). After adjusting for potential confounders, pain was significantly associated with depression (odds ratio [OR] 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.43 to 2.17). This association seemed to be modified by sex. Compared to male participants without pain, women with pain were significantly more likely to present with depression (OR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.29 to 2.42), while no significant difference was observed for women without pain (OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.22) and men with pain (OR = 1.24; 95% CI = 0.86 to 1.79). Among women, the association of pain and depression became progressively more pronounced as pain severity, pain frequency, and number of painful sites increased.
   Conclusion: This study documented that in a large sample of older adults living in the community, pain is associated with depression, especially among women.

TI Factors influencing the decision of older people living in independent
   units to enter the acute care system
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING

ID INFORMATION; SERVICES; NEEDS
AB Aims and objectives. This South Australian-based study explored and described the factors influencing the decision of older people living in the community in independent living units to enter the acute care system.
   Background. Community-based older Australians, an increasing population segment, make choices about support needed to optimize health and well-being. This includes when to enter the acute care system. Entering this system has potential risks as well as benefits. The current South Australian Department of Human Services policies of 'keeping older people out' of the acute care system has implications for prevention and early intervention measures and requires an understanding of how and why older people enter the acute care system.
   Method. In-depth interviews were conducted with older people (N = 31) and their families (N = 10), drawn from three South Australian aged care organizations providing independent living unit accommodation, and focus groups (N = 14) were conducted with stakeholders to identify factors influencing the decision of older people living in independent living units to enter the acute care system.
   Findings. Analysis of the data revealed eight facets influencing this group of older people's decision-making with respect to entering the acute care system; they were: expectations of support in the independent living unit not being met; the presence/absence of safety nets; lack of after-hours support; the desire to remain independent; the general practitioner as pivotal; the influence of others; perceptions of the emergency department; and having access to information.
   Relevance to practice. These facets provide insights into entry processes, links and relationships that form an interface between primary care, community care, the aged care industry and the acute system. Analysis of these insights highlight prevention and early intervention responses that can promote the health and well-being of older people, potential ways to streamline services, as well as gaps in current services.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to enhance retention among African American men enrolled in a cancer screening trial. Design and Methods: A telephone-based, randomized trial design was used. The intervention group included 352 African American men aged 55+. Case managers contacted participants at least monthly and provided information and referral services to participants and their relatives. Results: The mean age of participants was 65.7 years. A total of 14,978 calls were made resulting in 780 referrals. The 10 most frequent referrals were for scheduling medical appointments, health information, insurance information, legal aid, transportation, cancer screening information, information technology/computer information, employment, housekeeping/chore services, and food programs. Conclusions: The case managers served as links between participants and community-based resources. The types of referrals made could be associated with the age-related needs of the participants.

AB Background: In community settings, disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) use for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) falls short of treatment recommendations. This population-based study investigates the relationship between the use of DMARDs and specialty care in an insured population.
   Method: A cohort of individuals aged 65 or older with RA was identified from a population-based physician billing database in Ontario, Canada, together with information on visit rates to general and specialist physicians and visit-specific diagnoses. DMARD prescription data were obtained from the Ontario Drug Benefits Plan database. The proportions of individuals with RA using DMARDs and specialist care were calculated for the 43 counties in Ontario, and the relationship between the 2 was determined using logistic multilevel modeling, controlling for possible confounders.
   Results: A total of 13,698 RA individuals aged 65 or older were identified, representing 1% of the 65-or-older population. Within this cohort, 58% received DMARDs and 68% made 1 or more RA-related visits to a specialist in 3 years. There was considerable variation by county in both the proportion of those with RA making visits to specialists (39-82 per 100 RA population) and receiving DMARDs (36-81%). The use of DMARDs was significantly associated with the use of specialist services by individuals with RA (odds ratio 1.9 [95% confidence interval 1.87, 1.88] for counties with highest versus lowest proportional use of specialists) independent of effects of age, sex, income, and comorbidities.
   Conclusion: Even in a universally funded setting, suboptimal treatment of RA is associated with lack of access to specialist services. These findings are likely applicable to many jurisdictions worldwide.

TI Nutrition in the community -: an exploratory study of oral nutritional
   supplements in a health board area in Ireland
SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS
LA English
DT Article
DE community dietitians; malnutrition; nutritional assessments; older
   people; oral nutritional supplements; primary care practitioners
AB Background A review of the General Medical (Payments) Scheme data in the Midland Health Board (MHB) Ireland identified a spend of just over e 0.5 million on enteral nutritional supplements (oral and tube feeds) in an 11-month period in 1998 [General Medical Services (Payments) Board, 1998, MHB Clinical Nutritional Products: January-December 1998, Dublin]. In 2000, a figure of e5 million was reported as the annual spend (oral and tube feeds) [General Medical Services (Payments) Board, 2000, MHB Clinical Nutritional Products: January-December 2000, Dublin]. Research has shown that a high proportion of Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS) are inappropriately prescribed by primary care practitioners (Gall et al., 2001). The role of General Practitioners (GPs) and Public Health Nurses (PHNs) in prescribing ONS to patients aged 65 years and older was examined, as they are directly involved in the delivery of primary health care.
   Aim (i) Assess current trends, decision-making processes and monitoring procedures in the use of ONS for older patients in the community. (ii) Identify whether nutritional assessments and appropriate nutritional criteria are standard practice in determining selection of ONS.
   Methods A study was conducted among 99 GPs and 120 PHNs in the MHB. All GPs were selected to participate and 50% (60) of PHNs were randomly selected. A telephone questionnaire was administered to each subject over a 2-week period.
   Results Both GPs (78%) and PHNs (47%) reported that their prescription of/recommendations for ONS had increased in the last 4 years. None conducted a full nutritional assessment, but 25% of PHNs used a Nutrition Screening Tool when trying to ascertain whether a patient requires an ONS. Only 19.6% of GPs and 6.8% of PHNs surveyed were aware of the calorie content of a standard 200 mL ONS (sip-feed). In addition, a very significant proportion of both GPs and PHNs do not appear to give appropriate dietary advice to patients who may be at risk of malnutrition. Only 55% of GPs stated that they would specifically review a patient's ONS prescription. All GPs said that they would not conduct a full nutritional assessment at the review appointment.
   Conclusion The results of this study raise concerns as to the appropriateness of current ONS prescription and monitoring in the community. They also highlight the need for further intervention in the primary care setting in order to ensure that elderly malnourished patients are detected, treated and monitored in an appropriate and cost-effective manner.

   IMMUNIZATION; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; BEHAVIOR; RATES; CARE
AB Background: The content and context of the process of vaccinating older adults against influenza in outpatient settings has not been adequately described. Failure to appreciate the causal antecedents or precursors to the act of provider recommendation may explain why so many efficacious interventions identified by the U.S. Task Force on Community Preventive Services fail to be routinely implemented and why influenza immunization rates have remained static over the past decade.
   Methods: This study used critical path analysis from data collected during standardized workflow observations of patients more than 50 years of age from a convenience sample of 16 ambulatory care settings in San Diego, California; Rochester, New York; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Observations were made from October 23, 2001 to January 31, 2002.
   Results: In this study, 62% (151/243) of patients observed during scheduled extended visits received influenza vaccinations. When operational, temporal, and clinical factors are examined altogether through critical path analysis, a model of seven critical organizational support, temporal, and clinical activities emerges that is able to predict 93% of the immunizations. Variation from the model predicts 73% of the missed opportunities.
   Conclusions: Vaccination of adults should not be seen as simply an incremental activity added to the general health encounter. Assuring a high rate of vaccination requires adequate time and operational support. Provider-patient discussion is more productively viewed as the culmination of the immunization process, not the beginning. Finally, this study indicates the potential need to identify and compare processes of care associated with other specific preventive services.

AB Objective: Dementia is a major public health problem among the elderly in developed countries and a growing problem in the underdeveloped countries. There are no published data on dementia in any of the Arabic countries. The aim of this study was to determine the different sub-types of dementia among Qataris.
   Methods: A retrospective and prospective ongoing hospital-based study in which all medical records of the patients with diagnosis of dementia seen at the Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar, between June 1997 and June 2003, whether inpatient or outpatient were reviewed. Dementia was defined according to diagnostic and statistical manual (DSM) IV criteria. Those who had dementia were evaluated by a psychologist, psychiatrist, neurologist and a geriatrician. All had brain computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or both and routine blood tests. Finally, they were classified into sub-types according to the cause of dementia.
   Results: Out of 300 patients, 134 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, most of them were illiterate, married and non-smokers. Among those dementia sub-types were: Alzheimer disease (AD) 39 (29%), vascular dementia (VaD) 30 (22%), mixed AD and VaD 20 (15%) and Parkinson's disease with dementia 8 (6%) were noted. The rest of them had dementia due to other medical conditions.
   Conclusion: Our study showed that AD is more prevalent than VaD. It also showed that patients and their families seek medical help late due to the general belief among the public that forgetfulness and other associated cognitive impairment are part of the normal aging process. The emergence of new drugs and advancement in the prevention of cerebrovascular diseases makes early diagnosis of dementia sub-type important. A community based study, to show the real prevalence and incidence of sub-types of dementia, is highly indicated. These data are necessary for planning and setting up community services and health care programs for demented patients.
